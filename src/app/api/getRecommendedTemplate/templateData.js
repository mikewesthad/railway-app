    description: "A lightweight service for wrapping and unwrapping data encryption keys.",
    readme:
      'Introduction\n\nPraetorian is a zero dependency, lightweight service which wraps and unwraps data encryption keys over HTTP using a rotating root key. It is intentionally narrow in scope and uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM). Its purpose is to provide a simplified method for developers looking to implement Envelope encryption], a technique used to [encrypting sensitive data at rest].\n\nEnvelope encryption is a technique where data is encrypted with a Data Encryption Key (DEK), the DEK is encrypted using a Key Encryption Key (KEK). The term "envelope" refers to the process of wrapping one layer of encryption around another, akin to sealing a letter with multiple layers of envelopes for added security.\n\nData Encryption Key (DEK): A unique key is generated for each set of data to be encrypted. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data and should be symetric.\nKey Encryption Key (KEK): A higher-level key used to encrypt and protect the DEK. The KEK is an asymetric key stored securely in the Praetorian environment configuration.\n\nPraetorian provides the Key Encryption Key which can be rotated and exposes HTTP endpoints so Data Encryption Keys can be wrapped and unwrapped, without leaking any Key Encryption Key material.\n\n[envelope encryption]: https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption\n[encrypting sensitive data at rest]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption\n\n&gt; Throughout the remainder of this documentation, the term Key Encryption Key can be used interchangeably with Root Key.\n\nWhy use Praetorian?\n\nPraetorian is intended to be very easy to setup and great for startups looking to get moving quickly. If you\'re storing sensitive information in a database and want a simplified approach to using envelope encryption, you should use Praetorian.\n\nDeployment\n\nBefore you start, you\'ll need to create a valid Praetorian configuration. Run the following command from your local terminal to generate a JSON configuration which contains a single root key which will be set as the active root key.\n\necho $(printf \'{"activeKeyId": "1", "rootKeys": {"1": "%s"}}\' "$(openssl rand -base64 32)")\n\nHit the deployment button below and paste the JSON output from the previous command into the PRAETORIAN_CONFIG environment variable. Once the service has been built and deployed, Praetorian will be running and only available from the private interface.\n\n&gt; Do not expose your Praetorian service to the public internet!\n\n[Deploy on Railway\n\nWhen you deploy applications that interact with Praetorian, you will need to use http://praetorian as the base URL.\n\nUsage\n\nBefore integrating Praetorian into your application, it\'s best to start with a locally running instance so you can explore and familiarise yourself with the envelope encryption flow.\n\nAssuming you have Docker installed, start by running the following command to get a Praetorian container running and listening for requests on port 3000.\n\ndocker run --rm \\\n  --name=praetorian \\\n  --publish=3000:3000 \\\n  --env=PRAETORIAN_CONFIG="$(printf \'{"activeKeyId": "1", "rootKeys": {"1": "%s"}}\' "$(openssl rand -base64 32)")" \\\n  karlbateman/praetorian\n\nNow we have our Praetorian service running locally, we can issue a request to wrap a data encryption key using the following curl request.\n\ncurl --silent \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --data \'{"key": "abc123"}\' \\\n  http://localhost:3000/wrap\n\nTo unwrap this data, simply copy the response from the terminal and send it to the /unwrap endpoint.\n\ncurl --silent \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --data \'\' \\\n  http://localhost:3000/unwrap\n\nThis demonstrates the flow of wrapping and unwrapping data encryption keys. \n\nIntegrating\n\nWith Praetorian running in your Railway environment and accessible through a private networking address, the workflow is simple. Within your backend application, you would perform the following operations:\n\nGenerate a cryptographically secure data encryption key.\nUse this key to encrypt the sensitive information.\nSend a POST request to http://praetorian/wrap with the data encryption key as a JSON request body.\nStore the response body and the encrypted sensitive information in your DB.\n\n&gt; Every write/update operation to your database should perform this flow to\n&gt; ensure maximum security and integrity of your data. Every data encryption key\n&gt; should be unique at the row/doc level.\n\nWhen you want to read the data, you must perform the following steps within your backend application.\n\nRead the encrypted data and the wrapped data encryption key.\nSend a POST request to http://praetorian/unwrap with the wrapped data encryption key as a JSON request body.\nUse the unwrapped data encryption key from the response to decrypt the sensitive information.\n\n&gt; Never store an unwrapped data encryption key.\n',

    description: "Milvus Standalone: Cloud-native vector DB for scalable, fast ANN search.",
    readme:
      '\nWhat is Milvus?\n\n🐦 Milvus is a high-performance vector database built for scale. It powers AI applications by efficiently organizing and searching vast amounts of unstructured data, such as text, images, and multi-modal information.\n\n🧑‍💻 Written in Go and C++, Milvus uses CPU/GPU hardware acceleration for top vector search performance. Its fully-distributed and K8s-native architecture allows horizontal scaling, handling 10k+ queries on billion+ vectors with real-time streaming updates. Also supports Standalone mode for single machines and Milvus Lite (pip install for Python quickstarts).\n\nWant to use Milvus with zero setup? Try out Zilliz Cloud ☁️ for free. Milvus is available as a fully managed service on Zilliz Cloud, with Serverless, Dedicated and BYOC options available.\n\nFor questions about how to use Milvus, join the community on Discord to get help. For reporting problems, file bugs and feature requests in GitHub Issues or ask in Discussions.\n\nThe Milvus open-source project is\nunder LF AI &amp; Data Foundation, distributed with Apache 2.0 License, with Zilliz as its major contributor.\n\nQuickstart\n\n$ pip install -U pymilvus\nThis installs pymilvus, the Python SDK for Milvus. Use MilvusClient to create a client:\nfrom pymilvus import MilvusClient\n\npymilvus also includes Milvus Lite for quickstart. To create a local vector database, simply instantiate a client with a local file name for persisting data:\n\n  client = MilvusClient("milvus_demo.db")\n\nYou can also specify the credentials to connect to your deployed Milvus server or Zilliz Cloud:\n\n  client = MilvusClient(\n    uri="",\n    token="")\n\nWith the client, you can create collection:\nclient.create_collection(\n    collection_name="demo_collection",\n    dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo have 768 dimensions\n)\n\nIngest data:\nres = client.insert(collection_name="demo_collection", data=data)\n\nPerform vector search:\n\nquery_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries("Who is Alan Turing?", "What is AI?"])\nres = client.search(\n    collection_name="demo_collection",  # target collection\n    data=query_vectors,  # a list of one or more query vectors, supports batch\n    limit=2,  # how many results to return (topK)\n    output_fields=["vector", "text", "subject"],  # what fields to return\n)\n\nWhy Milvus\n\nMilvus excels at scalable vector search, storing vectors alongside scalar data for efficient filtered or hybrid searches. Developers choose Milvus for:\n\nHigh Performance at Scale and High Availability\nMilvus\'s [distributed architecture separates compute and storage for horizontal scaling and adapting to diverse traffic.

Verify your Resend API key and ensure your sender email is verified in Resend.\nFile uploads fail? Double-check your MinIO access key configuration.\nPayment processing issues? Ensure your Xendit account is properly verified and that you\'re using the correct API keys (development vs. production).\nWebhook verification failing? Confirm you\'ve copied the correct Xendit callback verification token.\nDatabase connection issues? Railway automatically manages your database, but you may need to restart the service if problems persist.\n\nFor additional help, check the GitHub repository or reach out to the team at Kugie.app.',

    readme:
      "GitHub Actions Runner Banner\n\nGitHub Actions Self Hosted Runners\n\nView a complete tutorial here -> https://docs.railway.com/tutorials/github-actions-runners\n\nSetup an ACCESS_TOKEN. This will enable the runner to self register with your GitHub organization or enterprise.\nAdd any extra labels you want for your runners.\nDeploy the template.\nClick on your new Service -> Settings -> Regions. Select the region(s) you want and the number of replicas you want.\nDeploy the changes and run some GitHub Actions!\n\nSetup a fine-grained PAT\nCreate a new fine-grained personal access token. Setup -> https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens\nSet the Resource owner as your organization. Alternatively, you can select your Enterprise or Repo. If you don't then you won't have access to organization scoped runners\nSet Expiration\nSet Repository Access\nUnder Permissions, Select Organization Permissions -> Self Hosted Runners -> Read and Write (If Enterprise, select Enterprise instead).\nYou don't need any other permissions!\n\nAdditional Configuration\nYou can set up additional configuration and settings from the GitHub repo.\n\nBest Practices\n\nAvoid Serverless\nUsing the Serverless Setting on this Service is not recommended and will result in idle runners disconnecting from GitHub and needing to reauthenticate. GitHub Runners have a 50 second HTTP longpoll which keeps them alive. While the runners in this template can automatically reauth with an ACCESS_TOKEN it will result in offline / abandoned runners.\n\nAvoid Docker-in-Docker\nRailway's current container model does not allow for docker containers inside its containers, which means any GitHub Actions workflow that pulls a container and runs it will fail.\n\nAbout GitHub Runners on Railway\nDeploying GitHub Actions Self Hosted Runners on Railway is an excellent way to run your own CI infrastructure because you only pay for what you use. With self-hosted runners, you also unlock the ability to cache expensive and time-consuming dependencies (node_modules, cargo, etc.) or large git repositories. Best of all, Railway's built-in replicas means you can scale your runners horizontally, or even distribute them to different data centers with just a click and redeploy. You'll save build times and costs over using standard runners, AND you'll unlock more sophistocated workflows -- without needing a PhD in DevOps.\n",

If you change these then the worker service also needs to be redeployed.\n\nBy default the emails are output in the logs. In order to verify the account email after registering, you'll need to look in the logs for the email output with the confirmation link. Might need to go in and click the button to resend the verification email to get it in the logs. Verifying the email is required prior to being able to setup MFA (otherwise the QR Code will not render).\n\nIf you'd like to enable email then you'll need to change the EMAIL_URL and DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL.

    description: "A Rust-based AI-powered automation API with secure webhook handling.",
    readme:
      "Earn Vaults is a robust, high-performance API built with Rust and powered by the Actix Web framework. Designed for modern web applications, Earn Vaults provides an efficient solution for managing user data, processing transactions, and integrating artificial intelligence for automated diagnostics and fixes. With a modular architecture, the project splits core functionalities into several components—authentication, task management, AI integration, administrative controls, and database operations—ensuring that each part of the application is maintainable and scalable.\n\nAt its core, Earn Vaults uses SQLite (via rusqlite) to store and manage user data and transaction histories. The use of SQLite with bundled support means that the database is lightweight and easily deployable, making it a great choice for projects where low resource consumption is key. Furthermore, environment variables are loaded securely using dotenvy, which ensures that sensitive configuration details like the database URL, API keys, and tokens are not hard-coded but managed externally. This makes the project secure and flexible across different deployment environments.\n\nThe project also leverages asynchronous programming with Tokio, which keeps the API responsive even under heavy load by efficiently managing multiple concurrent operations. A key feature is its AI-powered module that integrates with external AI services. This module not only helps in diagnosing issues and suggesting auto-fixes but also provides an administrative interface for real-time interaction and troubleshooting. With built-in webhook handling, the application can easily integrate with other services, allowing for automated triggers and notifications.\n\nFor deployment, Earn Vaults is optimized to run on Railway. Its Dockerfile is crafted using a slim Rust image for building and a minimal Debian image for the final deployment, ensuring low memory usage and fast startup times. This architecture, combined with Railway’s robust infrastructure, provides an ideal platform for scaling your application with ease.\n\nEarn Vaults is perfect for developers looking for a secure, scalable API solution that harnesses the power of Rust and AI, offering rapid deployment, automatic backups, and seamless integration with modern web services.\n",

      "Inngest is an event-driven durable execution platform that allows you to run fast, reliable code on any platform, without managing queues, infra, or state.\n\nWrite functions in TypeScript, Python or Go to power background and scheduled jobs, with steps built in.\n\nInngest handles the backend infra, queueing, scaling, concurrency, throttling, rate limiting, and observability for you.\n\nThe system is composed of the following services:\n\nEvent API - Receives events from SDKs via HTTP requests. Authenticates client requests via Event Keys. The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.\nEvent stream - Acts as buffer between the Event API and the Runner.\nRunner - Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:\nScheduling of new “function runs” (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the State store database. Runs are added to queues given the function's flow control configuration.\nResume functions paused via waitForEvent with matching expressions.\nCancels running functions with matching cancelOn expressions\nWrites ingested events to a database for historical record and future replay.\nQueue - A multi-tenant aware, multi-tier queue designed for fairness and various flow control methods (concurrency, throttling, prioritization, debouncing, rate limiting) and batching.\nExecutor - Responsible for executing functions, from initial execution, step execution, writing incremental function run state to the State store, and retries after failures.\nState store (database) - Persists data for pending and ongoing function runs. Data includes initial triggering event(s), step output and step errors.\nDatabase - Persists system data and history including Apps, Functions, Events, Function run results.\nAPI - GraphQL and REST APIs for programmatic access and management of system resources.\nDashboard UI - The UI to manage apps, functions and view function run history.\nThe source code for Inngest and all services is available on GitHub\n\nhttps://www.inngest.com/docs/self-hosting",

      "Langfuse GitHub Banner\n\nLangfuse is an open source LLM engineering platform. It helps teams collaboratively\ndevelop, monitor, evaluate, and debug AI applications. Langfuse can be self-hosted in minutes and is battle-tested.\n\nLangfuse Overview Video\n\n✨ Core Features\n\nLangfuse Overview\n\nLLM Application Observability: Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions. Try the interactive demo to see this in action.\n\nPrompt Management helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts. Thanks to strong caching on server and client side, you can iterate on prompts without adding latency to your application.\n\nEvaluations are key to the LLM application development workflow, and Langfuse adapts to your needs. It supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback collection, manual labeling, and custom evaluation pipelines via APIs/SDKs.\n\nDatasets enable test sets and benchmarks for evaluating your LLM application. They support continuous improvement, pre-deployment testing, structured experiments, flexible evaluation, and seamless integration with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n\nLLM Playground is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development. When you see a bad result in tracing, you can directly jump to the playground to iterate on it.\n\nComprehensive API: Langfuse is frequently used to power bespoke LLMOps workflows while using the building blocks provided by Langfuse via the API. OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and typed SDKs for Python, JS/TS are available.\n\n🔌 Integrations\n\nLangfuse Integrations\n\nMain Integrations:\n\n| Integration                                                                  | Supports                   | Description                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| SDK                                         | Python, JS/TS              | Manual instrumentation using the SDKs for full flexibility.                                                                                      |\n| OpenAI                      | Python, JS/TS              | Automated instrumentation using drop-in replacement of OpenAI SDK.                                                                               |\n| Langchain                | Python, JS/TS              | Automated instrumentation by passing callback handler to Langchain application.                                                                  |\n| LlamaIndex | Python                     | Automated instrumentation via LlamaIndex callback system.                                                                                        |\n| Haystack                  | Python                     | Automated instrumentation via Haystack content tracing system.                                                                                   |\n| LiteLLM                    | Python, JS/TS (proxy only) | Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT.

      "Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that helps teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications.\n\nLLM Application Observability: Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions. Try the interactive demo to see this in action.\n\nPrompt Management helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts. Thanks to strong caching on server and client side, you can iterate on prompts without adding latency to your application.\n\nEvaluations are key to the LLM application development workflow, and Langfuse adapts to your needs. It supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback collection, manual labeling, and custom evaluation pipelines via APIs/SDKs.\n\nDatasets enable test sets and benchmarks for evaluating your LLM application. They support continuous improvement, pre-deployment testing, structured experiments, flexible evaluation, and seamless integration with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n\nLLM Playground is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development. When you see a bad result in tracing, you can directly jump to the playground to iterate on it.\n\nComprehensive API: Langfuse is frequently used to power bespoke LLMOps workflows while using the building blocks provided by Langfuse via the API. OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, and typed SDKs for Python, JS/TS are available.\n\n",

      '\nPlikShare\n\nPlikShare is a self-hosted file sharing application that allows you to securely share files with others.\n\nFeatures\n\nSelf-hosted file sharing solution\nSecure file upload and download\nUser management\nAccess control\nFiles Encryption\nEasy deployment\n\nHey Claude, how to pronounce it?\nclaude_pronunciation\n\nI double-checked - he made no mistake this time. It\'s "pleek-share" (plēk-shâr)!\n\nWhere "Plik" in ancient Polish means "file".\n\n(Yeap, it\'s hard to find good domain name these times 🥲)\n\nHow to install\n\nAll the necessery instructions can be found here: https://plikshare.com/download\n\nDocker image is available here: https://hub.docker.com/r/damiankrychowski/plikshare\n\nHow to setup\n\nTo start using PlikShare you need to do two things: \nConfigure an email client (so that PlikShare can send notifications, confirm user emails etc.)\nConfigure a storage\n\nHow to upload files\nThe fastes way is to create zip archive out of the files you want to upload and then use PlikShare bulk upload feature!\n\nHow to download files\nMy favorite way to download files from PlikShare is to use explorer tree view - there you pick files and folders you want to have in your final archive and download them at once.\n\nHow to share files\nPlikShare allows you to create "boxes" - a layer that connects your folders to the external world. These boxes give you control over how others interact with your selected folders. With boxes, you can:\n\nInvite team members to collaborate\nCreate anonymous links with various permission levels\nSet up read-only boxes where others can only view content\nCreate upload-only boxes where users can add files without seeing existing content\n\nThis structured approach provides a secure and flexible way to share your files while maintaining precise control over access permissions.\n\nHow to preview files\nPlikShare includes a built-in preview function for various file formats. You can open videos, audio files, text files, PDFs, and it can render markdown files directly in the browser.\n\nI couldn\'t resist implementing ZIP file browsing capabilities as well. This feature allows you to navigate through ZIP archives and even preview files contained within them without having to extract the archive first.\n\nMarkdown Files\nPlikShare can render markdown files and it supports mermaid diagrams. Markdown files are also the only files in PlikShare (for now!) that can be directly edited.\n\nWhy? It\'s connected with my development plans for the app. My long-term goal is to integrate PlikShare seamlessly with AI such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., and markdown seems like a natural choice for a file format that is both easy for people to write and for AI to understand.\n\nIntegration: AWS Textract (OCR)\nThe first integration I added to PlikShare is Textract - it allows users to extract text from PDFs (or images). To configure Textract, we first need to configure AWS S3 as storage, because Textract operates on files stored there.\n\n\nWhen S3 is configured, we need to add the Textract integration (it\'s important to prepare access keys with appropriate permissions - but in case of any mistakes, the configuration test should fail and inform us what is wrong).\n\n\nAnd finally, when everything is ready, we can extract text from a PDF:\n\n\nHow does it work? Behind the scenes, PlikShare copies a file into the Textract storage, triggers the extraction, copies the result back into the original workspace, and then removes the file from AWS S3. Fancy!\n\nIntegration: Chat GPT\nThe second integration is the possibility to use your text files with ChatGPT and run queries against them. That\'s why I started with OCR so that I can have an easy way to convert PDF -&gt; text and not worry about how to push PDF into AI directly as these are still very early stages of these integrations. \n\nTo use ChatGPT, we need to configure it first, and then an additional option at the file preview level is available to talk to chat and to include the file (or its attachments) in the query. What is convenient is the possibility to convert all files produced by AI into file attachments - just as Textract results were stored as attachments.\n\nContact Information\nHaving trouble with self-hosting or interested in a managed version with support?\nSchedule a call: https://cal.com/damian.krychowski\nEmail: damian.krychowski@hey.com\n\nLicense\n\nPlikShare is developed and maintained by Damian Krychowski.\nPlikShare is distributed under\nan AGPLv3 license.\n\nTrademark\n\nThe name "PlikShare" and the PlikShare logo are trademarks owned by Damian Krychowski and are not covered by the AGPLv3 license.

      "✨ Features\n\nQueueing system with BullMQ and Redis;\nDashboard built with bull-board and Fastify;\nRun services through pm2.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/ncontiero/fastify-bullmq\n\nExplanations\n\nThis application uses BullMQ, a Redis-based queueing system, and Bull-Board, a dashboard to monitor and manage these queues, served by a Fastify server. Both services are built using Rslib and managed by PM2.\n\nThere are three distinct ways to start the services:\n\nUnified Execution: To start both services simultaneously, use the command pnpm start. This is the simplest option for local development.\nSeparate Execution: To start the worker and Fastify server individually, use the commands pnpm start:worker and pnpm start:server, respectively. This approach offers greater control and is used in this template, but can be easily adapted to your needs.\nDirect Node.js Execution: For simple projects that do not require PM2 features, direct execution with Node.js can result in lower resource consumption. Use node ./dist/worker.js for the worker and node ./dist/server.js for the Fastify server.\n\nPM2 also supports Bun. If desired, you can replace the project's package manager with Bun and execute the TypeScript files directly (Bun has native support for TypeScript), eliminating the need for a build. However, be aware that Bun is not fully compatible with Node.js, which may result in execution problems.\n\nScalability (PM2): Both services support horizontal scaling through the WORKER_INSTANCES and SERVER_INSTANCES environment variables. Set these variables to the desired number of instances to increase the processing capacity of the worker and server, respectively. These variables will only take effect if PM2 is being used.\n",

    readme:
      'SQL Chat banner\n\nWhat\n\nSQL Chat is a chat-based SQL client, which uses natural language to communicate with the database to implement operations such as query, modification, addition, and deletion of the database.\n\nScreenshot\n\nScreenshot\n\nScreenshot\n\nWhy\n\nAs we enter the Developer Tools 2.0 era,\nthere is a massive opportunity to rebuild the existing tools using the chat-based interface. SQL Client\nis no exception. Instead of navigating across many UI controls, a chat-based interface is much\nmore intuitive. Of course, only if that works, and our goal is to deliver that experience.\n\nHow\n\nSQL Chat is built by Next.js, it supports the following databases and will add more over time:\n\nMySQL\nPostgreSQL\nMSSQL\nTiDB Cloud\n\nsqlchat.ai\n\nIP Whitelisting\n\nIf you use sqlchat.ai to connect to your database, you need to add 0.0.0.0 (allow all connections)\nto the database whitelist IP. Because sqlchat.AI is hosted on Vercel which uses dynamic IP. If this is a concern, please consider the self-host option below.\n\nData Privacy\n\nSee SQL Chat Privacy Policy.\n\nSelf-host\n\nDocker\n\nIf you just want to run for your own use, supply the following options:\n\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET\nOPENAI_API_KEY\n\ndocker run --name sqlchat --platform linux/amd64 --env NEXTAUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 5)" --env OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;&gt; -p 3000:3000 --hostname localhost sqlchat/sqlchat\n\nPass an arbitrary string to NEXTAUTH_SECRET otherwise next-auth will complain.\nIf you chat to the database on the same host, you need to use host.docker.internal as the host in\n  the database connection setting.\n\nStartup options\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you just want to use for yourself, then run without database. Check .env.nodb.\nIf you want to offer a similar service as sqlchat.ai, then run with database, check .env.usedb. The database is used to store account, usage info.\n\nOpenAI related\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY: OpenAI API key. You can get one from here.\n\nOPENAI_API_ENDPOINT: OpenAI API endpoint. Defaults to https://api.openai.com. Use Ollama to set up self-host AI model and set the endpoint to it.\n\nNEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_SELF_OPENAI_KEY: Set to true to allow users to bring their own OpenAI API key.\n\nDatabase related\n\nNEXT_PUBLIC_USE_DATABASE: Set to true to start SQL Chat with database. This will\n  enable following features:\n  Account system.\n  Per-user quota enforcement.\n  Payment.\n  Usage data collection.\nDATABASE_URL: Applicable if NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_DATABASE is true.

Always change default password. ⚠️\n\n📚 Project Definition\n\nBookStack is an opinionated documentation platform that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it, but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.\n\nBookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above.\n\nIn regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. We aim to slowly yet continuously evolve the platform while providing a stable & easy upgrade path. \n\nYou can read more about the project and its origins in our FAQ here.\n\n🛠️ Development & Testing\n\nPlease see our development docs for full details regarding work on the BookStack source code.\n\nIf you're just looking to customize or extend your own BookStack instance, take a look at our Hacking BookStack documentation page for details on various options to achieve this without altering the BookStack source code.\n\nDetails about BookStack's versioning scheme and the general release process can be found here.\n\n🌎 Translations\n\nTranslations for text within BookStack is managed through the BookStack project on Crowdin. Some strings have colon-prefixed variables such as :userName. Leave these values as they are as they will be replaced at run-time.\n\nPlease use Crowdin to contribute translations instead of opening a pull request. The translations within the working codebase can be out-of-date, and merging via code can cause conflicts & sync issues. If for some reason you can't use Crowdin feel free to open an issue to discuss alternative options. \n\nIf you'd like a new language to be added to Crowdin, for you to be able to provide translations for, please open a new issue here.\n\nPlease note, translations in BookStack are provided to the \"Crowdin Global Translation Memory\" which helps BookStack and other projects with finding translations. If you are not happy with contributing to this then providing translations to BookStack, even manually via GitHub, is not advised.\n\n🎁 Contributing, Issues & Pull Requests\n\nFeel free to create issues to request new features or to report bugs & problems.

    description: "Effortlessly upload and save images as WebP with API key security.",
    readme:
      'Overview\n\nThe Image Upload API enables developers to easily upload images, which are then automatically processed and converted to WebP format. The API guarantees security by utilizing API key authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can upload files. For maximum performance and security, the API integrates with  Gumlet for optimal image delivery speed.\nGumlet Integration for Speed\nTo ensure fast delivery of images, the Gumlet CDN is used. Gumlet optimizes image sizes and ensures that they load quickly on your site or app. By integrating Gumlet with the upload system, you can maximize performance without compromising image quality.\n\nHow to Integrate Gumlet\n\nKey Features\n\nImage Upload: Accepts image file uploads (JPEG, PNG, WebP).\nWebP Conversion: Converts images to WebP format for optimized file size without significant loss of quality.\nAPI Key Authentication: Ensures security by validating API keys provided in requests.\nFile Storage: Stores files on the server and provides URLs for accessing them.\nCORS Support: The API can be accessed from allowed domains only.\nFile Size Limits: Defines a maximum file size for uploads (e.g., 25MB per file).\nGumlet Integration: Leverage Gumlet for faster image delivery.\n\nEndpoints\n\n1. POST /upload\n\nThis endpoint handles the upload of image files. The file will be processed (resized, converted to WebP) and stored on the server.\n\nRequest Headers:\n\nx-api-key: The API key required to authenticate the request. This must match the key set in the server\'s environment.\n\nRequest Body:\n\nimage: The image file to be uploaded (JPEG, PNG, or WebP). This should be sent as multipart/form-data.\n\nResponse:\n\n200 OK:\n  filePath: URL to access the uploaded image (in WebP format).\n  message: A success message indicating that the image has been uploaded and processed.\n  \n400 Bad Request:\n  error: Error message indicating that the uploaded file is not a valid image or is missing.\n\n403 Forbidden:\n  error: Error message if the API key provided is invalid or missing.\n\n500 Internal Server Error:\n  error: General error message indicating a server-side issue.\n\nHow to Use the API\n\nObtain API Key: \n   Before making any requests to the API, you must obtain a valid API key from the server administrator.\n   \nMake a POST Request to /upload:\n   To upload an image, send a POST request to the /upload endpoint with the following:\n     Headers: Include your API key in the x-api-key header.\n     Body: Attach the image you want to upload in the image field of the form data.\n   \nProcess the Response:\n   If successful, the response will contain a URL (filePath) where the uploaded image can be accessed.\n   If the file is not an image or is missing, the API will return an error message.\n\nError Handling\n\nThe API provides clear error messages in case something goes wrong. Here are the possible errors and their meanings:\n\nNo file uploaded: This error occurs if the request does not contain an image file.\nInvalid file type: This error is returned if the uploaded file is not a valid image (e.g., a non-image file type).\nInvalid API key: If the x-api-key header is missing or incorrect, the request will be rejected with a "Forbidden" error.\nServer error: If something goes wrong on the server (e.g., a failure in processing the image), an internal server error will be returned.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nThe API uses API keys to authenticate requests, ensuring that only authorized users can upload files. The server checks the key provided in the x-api-key header of the request against a predefined value stored in the server\'s environment variables. If the key is invalid or missing, the request will be denied.\n\nFile Storage\n\nUploaded images are stored in the server\'s file system. The files are saved in the /files/images directory and are accessible through URLs returned in the response. The URL format follows the structure:\n\nhttps://your-cdn-link/files/images/{image-id}.webp\n\nThis link can be used to display or download the uploaded images. Images are optimized and delivered via the Gumlet CDN to ensure high speed and reduced loading times.\n\nFile Size Limits\n\nTo prevent overloading the server, the API imposes a file size limit on uploads. The default file size limit is 25MB. If a user attempts to upload a file that exceeds this size, they will receive a "File too large" error.\n\nResponse Examples\n\nHere are example responses for various outcomes:\n\nSuccess Response (200 OK)\n\n{\n    "filePath": "https://your-cdn-link/files/images/abc123.webp",\n    "message": "Image uploaded and processed successfully."\n}\n\nError Response (400 Bad Request)\n\n{\n    "error": "No file uploaded"\n}\n\nError Response (403 Forbidden)\n\n{\n    "error": "Forbidden: Invalid API Key"\n}\n\nError Response (500 Internal Server Error)\n\n{\n    "error": "An error occurred while processing the image."\n}\n\nConclusion\n\nThis API is designed to make image uploading and processing simple for developers. With the ability to handle various image formats, secure file uploads with API key authentication, and store images on the server with easy-to-access URLs, it provides a robust solution for any application that needs image handling capabilities. Additionally, by integrating Gumlet for optimized delivery, this API offers a complete solution.\n\nFor detailed guides, check the following links:\nIntegrate Gumlet for Speed\n\nIf you have any questions or issues, please contact the server administrator or refer to the project\'s repository for more information.\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.

    readme:
      "PostgreSQL v17 with pgvector\n\nTL;DR: This template is like the existing pgvector template, but with PostgreSQL v17 instead of PostgreSQL v16.\n\nWhat is PGVector?\n\nPGVector is an extension for PostgreSQL that enables efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings, making it ideal for machine learning and AI applications like similarity search. It adds support for vector data types and indexing methods to facilitate quick querying on high-dimensional vectors.\n\nHow to Use the Template\n\nThis template provides PostgreSQL v17 with the pgvector extension pre-installed. You’ll need to enable the pgvector extension in each database where you intend to use it.\n\nConnection Setup:\n   Find the appropriate connection string under the service variables tab:\n     DATABASE_URL: Used for connecting from other Railway services.\n     DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL: Used for connecting from external services/tools.\n   Reference these URLs in your other services variables as needed (For instance, ${{ pgvector.DATABASE_URL }})\n\nEnabling PGVector Extension:\n   Before using pgvector, you must enable the extension in your database:\n   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;\n\nExample Usage Script\n\nHere’s a simple example to verify that the pgvector extension is set up and working as expected:\n   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;\n   \n   -- Create a table with an embedding vector\n   CREATE TABLE items (\n       id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,\n       embedding vector(3)\n   );\n   \n   -- Insert some example data\n   INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES \n   ('[1,2,3]'), \n   ('[4,5,6]');\n   \n   -- Perform a vector similarity search\n   SELECT * FROM items \n   ORDER BY embedding &lt;-&gt; '[3,1,2]' \n   LIMIT 5;\n\nThis SQL snippet sets up the pgvector extension, creates a table, inserts data, and runs a basic similarity query using the &lt;-&gt; operator to measure vector distance.\n\nFurther Information\n\nFor more details on PGVector, visit the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector",

You can take full control and edit anything you'd need to as you scale.\nOne-Click Deploy: Get a complete Grafana-based observability stack running in minutes.\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\nClick the \"Deploy on Railway\" button at the top of this page\nEnter your desired Grafana admin username in the GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER variable\nLeave all other variables at their defaults (or customize as needed)\nWait for your stack to deploy (this typically takes 3-5 minutes)\nNavigate to the Grafana URL provided by Railway\nLog in with your admin username and the auto-generated password found in the GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable\nHook up your applications to the datasources.\nCreate dashboards, alerts, and explore your data in Grafana!\n\nOptional Variables\n\n| Variable | Description | Default |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER | Username for the Grafana admin account | Required input |\n| GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD | Password for the Grafana admin account | Auto-generated secure string |\n| GF_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME | Name of your Grafana instance | Grafana on Railway |\n| GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS | Comma-separated list of Grafana plugins to install | grafana-simple-json-datasource,grafana-piechart-panel,grafana-worldmap-panel,grafana-clock-panel |\n\nInternal Service URLs\n\nThe Grafana service exposes these environment variables that you can reference in your other Railway applications to easily send data to your observability stack:\n\n| Variable | Description | Usage |\n|----------|-------------|-------|\n| LOKI_INTERNAL_URL | Internal URL for the Loki service | Use in your applications to send logs to and query Loki |\n| PROMETHEUS_INTERNAL_URL | Internal URL for the Prometheus service | Use in your applications to send metrics to and query Prometheus |\n| TEMPO_INTERNAL_URL | Internal URL for the Tempo service | Use in your applications to query Tempo |\n\nThese variables make it easy to configure your other Railway services to send telemetry data to your observability stack.\n\nTempo also exposes a few variables to make it easier to push tracing information to the service using either HTTP or GRPC\n\n| Variable | Description | Usage |\n|----------|-------------|-------|\n| INTERNAL_HTTP_INGEST | Internal HTTP ingest server URL for Tempo | Use in your applications to send traces to tempo via HTTP |\n| INTERNAL_GRPC_INGEST | Internal GRPC ingest server URL for Tempo | Use in your applications to send traces to tempo via GRPC |\n\nVersion Control\n\nEach service has its own VERSION environment variable that can be set independently in each service's settings in the Railway dashboard:\n\nGrafana Service: Set VERSION to control the Grafana Docker image tag\nLoki Service: Set VERSION to control the Loki Docker image tag\nPrometheus Service: Set VERSION to control the Prometheus Docker image tag\nTempo Service: Set VERSION to control the Tempo Docker image tag\n\nBy default, all services use the latest tag, but you can pin specific versions for stability:\n\nExamples:\nGrafana: VERSION=11.5.2\nLoki: VERSION=3.4.2\nPrometheus: VERSION=v3.2.1\nTempo: VERSION=v2.7.1\n\nThis allows you to update each component independently as needed.\n\nProject Structure & Services\n\nThis template deploys four interconnected services:\n\nGrafana\nThe central visualization and dashboarding platform\nPre-configured with connections to all other services\nPersistent volume for storing dashboards, users, and configurations\nComes with useful plugins pre-installed\nExposes internal URLs for other Railway services to connect to Loki, Prometheus, and Tempo\n\nPrometheus\nTime-series database for metrics collection\nConfigured with sensible defaults for monitoring\nPersistent volume for metrics data\n\nLoki\nLog aggregation system designed to be cost-effective\nHorizontally scalable architecture\nPersistent volume for log storage\n\nTempo\nDistributed tracing system for tracking requests across services\nHigh-performance trace storage\nPersistent volume for trace data\n\nAll services are deployed using official Docker images and configured to work together seamlessly.\n\nConnecting Your Applications\n\nUsing Locomotive for Loki\n\nYou can easily ingest all of your railway logs into Loki from any service using Locomotive. Just spin up their template, drop in your Railway API key, the ID of the services you want to monitor, and a link to your new Loki instance and logs will start flowing! no code changes needed anywhere!\n\nUsing OpenTelemetry libraries for Tempo \n\nTempo is a bit different than both Prometheus and Loki in that exposes separate GRPC and HTTP servers on ports :4317 and :4318 respectively specifically for ingesting your tracing data or \"spans\".\n\nWhen configuring your application to send traces to Tempo, please use one of the preconfigured variables in the Tempo service: INTERNAL_HTTP_INGEST or INTERNAL_GRPC_INGEST.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the ingest API endpoint for the HTTP server is /v1/traces. For a working example of this in a node.js express API, see /examples/api/tracer.js in our GitHub repository.\n\nUsing otherwise standard observability tooling\n\nTo send data from your other Railway applications to this observability stack:\n\nIn your application's Railway service, add environment variables that reference the internal URLs:\n   LOKI_URL=${{Grafana.LOKI_INTERNAL_URL}}\n   PROMETHEUS_URL=${{Grafana.PROMETHEUS_INTERNAL_URL}}\n   TEMPO_URL=${{Grafana.TEMPO_INTERNAL_URL}}\nConfigure your application's logging, metrics, or tracing libraries to use these URLs\nYour application data will automatically appear in your Grafana dashboards\n\nCustomizing Your Stack\n\nTo customize the configuration of Loki, Prometheus, or Tempo:\n\nFork the GitHub repository\nModify the configuration files in their respective directories\nIn Railway, disconnect the service you want to customize\nReconnect the service to your forked repository\nDeploy the updated service\n\nThe pre-configured Grafana connections will continue to work with your customized services.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nLocomotive: a loki transport for railway services\nGrafana Documentation\nLoki Documentation\nPrometheus Documentation\nTempo Documentation\nGrafana Community Forums\nGrafana Plugins Directory\n\nDeveloped and maintained by Mykal.

If you're coming from Airtable, you'll find the model familiar (and there's also our Grist vs Airtable article for a direct comparison).\n\nHere are some specific feature highlights of Grist:\n\n  Python formulas.\n    Full Python syntax is supported, including the standard library.\n    Many Excel functions also available.\n    An AI Assistant specifically tuned for formula generation (using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo or Llama via llama-cpp-python).\n  A portable, self-contained format.\n    Based on SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine.\n    Any tool that can read SQLite can read numeric and text data from a Grist file.\n    Enables backups that you can confidently restore in full.\n    Great for moving between different hosts.\n  Can be displayed on a static website with grist-static – no special server needed.\n  A self-contained desktop app for viewing and editing locally: grist-desktop.\n  Convenient editing and formatting features.\n    Choices and choice lists, for adding colorful tags to records.\n    References and reference lists, for cross-referencing records in other tables.\n    Attachments, to include media or document files in records.\n    Dates and times, toggles, and special numerics such as currency all have specialized editors and formatting options.\n    Conditional Formatting, letting you control the style of cells with formulas to draw attention to important information.\n  Drag-and-drop dashboards.\n    Charts, card views and a calendar widget for visualization.\n    Summary tables for summing and counting across groups.\n    Widget linking streamlines filtering and editing data.\n    Grist has a unique approach to visualization, where you can lay out and link distinct widgets to show together,\n    without cramming mixed material into a table.\n    Filter bar for quick slicing and dicing.\n  Incremental imports.\n    Import a CSV of the last three months activity from your bank...\n    ...and import new activity a month later without fuss or duplication.\n  Integrations.\n    A REST API, Zapier actions/triggers, and support from similar integrators.\n    Import/export to Google drive, Excel format, CSV.\n    Link data with custom widgets, hosted externally.\n    Configurable outgoing webhooks.\n  Many templates to get you started, from investment research to organizing treasure hunts.\n  Access control options.\n    (You'll need SSO logins set up to make use of these options; grist-omnibus has a prepackaged solution if configuring this feels daunting)\n    Share individual documents, workspaces, or team sites.\n    Control access to individual rows, columns, and tables.\n    Control access based on cell values and user attributes.\n  Self-maintainable.\n    Useful for intranet operation and specific compliance requirements.\n  Sandboxing options for untrusted documents.\n    On Linux or with Docker, you can enable gVisor sandboxing at the individual document level.\n    On macOS, you can use native sandboxing.\n    On any OS, including Windows, you can use a wasm-based sandbox.\n  Translated to many languages.\n  F1 key brings up some quick help.

    readme:
      'Prefect\n\nPrefect is a workflow orchestration framework for building data pipelines in Python.\nIt\'s the simplest way to elevate a script into a production workflow.\nWith Prefect, you can build resilient, dynamic data pipelines that react to the world around them and recover from unexpected changes.\n\nWith just a few lines of code, data teams can confidently automate any data process with features such as scheduling, caching, retries, and event-based automations.\n\nWorkflow activity is tracked and can be monitored with a self-hosted Prefect server instance or managed Prefect Cloud dashboard.\n\n!TIP]\nPrefect flows can handle retries, dependencies, and even complex branching logic\n\n[Check our docs or see the example below to learn more!\n\nGetting started\n\nPrefect requires Python 3.9 or later. To install the latest or upgrade to the latest version of Prefect, run the following command:\n\npip install -U prefect\n\nThen create and run a Python file that uses Prefect flow and task decorators to orchestrate and observe your workflow - in this case, a simple script that fetches the number of GitHub stars from a repository:\n\nfrom prefect import flow, task\nimport httpx\n\n\n@task(log_prints=True)\ndef get_stars(repo: str):\n    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}"\n    count = httpx.get(url).json()"stargazers_count"]\n    print(f"{repo} has {count} stars!")\n\n\n@flow(name="GitHub Stars")\ndef github_stars(repos: list[str]):\n    for repo in repos:\n        get_stars(repo)\n\nrun the flow!\nif name=="main":\n    github_stars(["PrefectHQ/Prefect"])\n\nFire up a Prefect server and open the UI at http://localhost:4200 to see what happened:\n\nprefect server start\n\nTo run your workflow on a schedule, turn it into a deployment and schedule it to run every minute by changing the last line of your script to the following:\n\nif name == "main":\n    github_stars.serve(\n        name="first-deployment",\n        cron="* * * * *",\n        parameters={"repos": ["PrefectHQ/prefect"]}\n    )\n\nYou now have a process running locally that is looking for scheduled deployments!\nAdditionally you can run your workflow manually from the UI or CLI. You can even run deployments in response to [events.\n\n!TIP]\nWhere to go next - check out our [documentation to learn more about:\n- Deploying flows to production environments\n- Adding error handling and retries\n- Integrating with your existing tools\n- Setting up team collaboration features\n\nPrefect Cloud\n\nPrefect Cloud provides workflow orchestration for the modern data enterprise. By automating over 200 million data tasks monthly, Prefect empowers diverse organizations — from Fortune 50 leaders such as Progressive Insurance to innovative disruptors such as Cash App — to increase engineering productivity, reduce pipeline errors, and cut data workflow compute costs.\n\nRead more about Prefect Cloud here or sign up to try it for yourself.\n\nprefect-client\n\nIf your use case is geared towards communicating with Prefect Cloud or a remote Prefect server, check out our\nprefect-client. It is a lighter-weight option for accessing client-side functionality in the Prefect SDK and is ideal for use in ephemeral execution environments.\n\nNext steps\n\nCheck out the Docs.\nJoin the Prefect Slack community.\nLearn how to contribute to Prefect.',

You will also need to configure any required variables for the provider you choose, e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY if you choose openai as your provider. You can find out more about configuring the providers in the provider documentation and the required environment variables for each provider under their respective pages.\n\nIf there are other environment variables you would like to configure that are not in the deployment template, you can add them to your services in the Railway project canvas after deploying the template.\n\nAfter deploying the core services, Railway will give you a public URL for the ragpi-api service which you can use to access the API. You can also enable API authentication by setting the RAGPI_API_KEY environment variable on the ragpi-api service and using it to authenticate requests to the API.\n\nDeploying Integrations\n\nEach Ragpi integration has its own Railway deployment template. Once you have deployed the core Ragpi services, you can deploy integrations like Slack and Discord by adding a new service to your project canvas. You can do this on your project's Architecture page by clicking the Create button, selecting the Template option, and searching for the integration you want to deploy, e.g., Ragpi Discord Integration or Ragpi Slack Integration.\n\nAfter selecting the integration template, you will need to configure the required environment variables for the integration. The RAGPI_BASE_URL environment variable should already be set to the URL of the ragpi-api service you deployed earlier. If you enabled API authentication, the RAGPI_API_KEY environment variable should also be set to the API key you configured for the ragpi-api service. You can find the required environment variables for each integration in the integration's documentation.",

You also don't need any programming knowledge to use Automatisch.\n\nPost-deployment instructions\n\nUse user@automatisch.io email address and sample password to login to Automatisch. Please do not forget to change your email and password from the settings page.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThere are other existing solutions in the market, like Zapier and Integromat, so you might be wondering why you should use Automatisch.\n\n✅ One of the main benefits of using Automatisch is that it allows you to store your data on your own servers, which is essential for businesses that handle sensitive user information and cannot risk sharing it with external cloud services. This is especially relevant for industries such as healthcare and finance, as well as for European companies that must adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n🤓 Your contributions are vital to the development of Automatisch. As an open-source software, anyone can have an impact on how it is being developed.\n\n💙 No vendor lock-in. If you ever decide that Automatisch is no longer helpful for your business, you can switch to any other provider, which will be easier than switching from the one cloud provider to another since you have all data and flexibility.\n",

      "Loki is a horizontally scalable, multi-tenant log aggregation system created by Grafana Labs. It is designed for efficient and cost-effective log storage and retrieval and is often used alongside Grafana for visualization.\n\nLoki's Key Features\nIndex-Free Logging: Unlike traditional logging systems like Elasticsearch, Loki does not index the contents of logs. Instead, it indexes only the metadata (labels), making it much cheaper and faster for ingestion.\nLabel-Based Log Searching: Logs are identified using labels (like job, instance, namespace), making queries efficient without the complexity of full-text indexing.\nIntegration with Prometheus: Loki follows a design philosophy similar to Prometheus, using labels and supporting queries via LogQL (similar to PromQL for metrics).\nEfficient Storage: Loki compresses logs and stores them in chunks, often using object storage like S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage to reduce costs.\nMulti-Tenant & Scalable: Loki supports multi-tenancy and horizontally scales, meaning it can handle large volumes of logs across distributed systems.\n\nGuides\nSetup Loki with an open telemetry collector\nAdd Loki as a Grafana Data Source",

    readme:
      "This Grafana template provides a starting point for building a powerful monitoring dashboard that helps administrators visualize key data for infrastructure, operations, and performance metrics.\n\nWhat's grafana?\nGrafana is an open-source tool that enables users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards for monitoring and analyzing time series data. It can pull data from a wide variety of sources, including databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus), cloud services (like AWS and Azure), and custom applications, making it a versatile solution for consolidating data from multiple systems.\n\nWith Grafana, users can design visually rich dashboards using customizable panels such as graphs, tables, and gauges. These panels support different visualizations like line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and more. In addition to displaying data, Grafana allows users to perform data transformations, aggregations, and set up alerts based on specific thresholds.\n\nThe platform also offers an interactive experience, allowing you to zoom in on time ranges, drill down into data points, and apply filters to focus on specific aspects of your data. Grafana dashboards support annotations, so you can add context, notes, and comments directly within the dashboard, helping to clarify insights.\n\nPersistent?\n\nTo ensure data persistence, we've mounted a volume at /var/lib/grafana. This setup guarantees that your data remains intact, even across system restarts.\n\nPlugins\n\nGrafana’s plugin ecosystem significantly extends its functionality. With the ability to integrate additional data sources, visualization types, and authentication options, Grafana can be tailored to fit any use case. You can easily explore and install community-developed plugins from the official Grafana Plugin Repository: Grafana Plugins.\n\nWidely adopted across industries, Grafana is ideal for infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), and business intelligence. Its flexibility, rich visualizations, and extensibility make it a go-to solution for anyone looking to extract valuable insights from their data.",

    readme:
      "FerretDB is an open-source alternative to MongoDB.\nIt is a proxy that converts MongoDB 5.0+ wire protocol queries to SQL and uses PostgreSQL with DocumentDB extension as a database engine.\n\nConnecting to FerretDB\n\nFerretDB is a drop-in replacement for MongoDB so you can simply construct a mongodb connection string like this: mongodb://{{postgres_username}}:{{postgres_password}}@{{railway_tcp_url}}:{{railway_tcp_port}}/\n\nFor {{postgres_username}} and {{postgres_password}}, they are autogenerated by the Postgres service deployed by the template.\n\nFor {{railway_tcp_url}} and {{railway_tcp_port}}, they are autogenerated by the FerretDB service deployed by the template.\n\nWhy do we need FerretDB?\n\nMongoDB was originally an eye-opening technology for many of us developers, empowering us to build applications faster than using relational databases.\nIn its early days, its ease-to-use and well-documented drivers made MongoDB one of the simplest database solutions available.\nHowever, as time passed, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots;\nchanging the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open-source and early-stage commercial projects.\n\nMost MongoDB users do not require any advanced features offered by MongoDB;\nhowever, they need an easy-to-use open-source document database solution.\nRecognizing this, FerretDB is here to fill that gap.",

      "A PostgreSQL deployment template for Railway, enabling quick setup with the Wal2Json plugin.\n\nFor more details about the Wal2Json plugin -> https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json\n\nAbout Wal2Json\n\nPostgreSQL records all changes—INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs—in a log called the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). This log ensures database consistency and allows for replication and recovery. However, WAL data is stored in a format optimized for internal database operations, not direct consumption.\n\nWal2Json bridges this gap by converting WAL changes into structured JSON output, making it easier for applications to process database updates in real time. This is especially useful for data replication, change auditing, event-driven architectures, and streaming data to external systems. The plugin works by using logical decoding, allowing applications to read database changes without requiring full physical replication.\n\nDepending on configuration, UPDATE and DELETE operations can include previous row versions, making it possible to track before-and-after states of data changes. Changes can be consumed via logical replication slots for continuous streaming or queried directly using a SQL API.",

Vince Analytics is a lightweight alternative that runs on a single server, a Go binary that takes advantages of optimized storage technologies like roaring bitmaps.\n\nYou can save lots of money by using Vince Analytics instead of other analytics services if it's capable enough for your use case.\n\nDeployment Steps\n\nDeploy on Railway  \n   Click the button below to deploy:\n\nDeploy on Railway\n\nConfigure Environment Variables  \n   When deploying, set the following environment variables in the Railway dashboard, when prompted to during template deployment:\n\n   VINCE_ADMIN_NAME: The admin username for Vince Analytics.\n   VINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: The admin password for Vince Analytics, this is what you'll use to log in.\n\nAccess the Vince Analytics Dashboard  \n   Once the deployment is complete, a Railway managed domain with SSL and a subdomain will be generated to access Vince Analytics.\n\nLogin  \n   Use the credentials you configured in the environment variables to log in. You'll usually just be prompted for the password.\n\nYou'll then be able to add a domain for tracking, prompting you to add a tracking code to your website. Once a domain is added, you'll be able to view your data in the dashboard.\n\nVince Analytics Dashboard\n\nNotes\n\nRailway automatically manages container restarts and scaling.\nA volume is mounted to the container to persist data between server restarts.\nTo change your admin credentials, you'll need to update the environment variables in the Railway dashboard and redeploy.\n\nFor further information about Vince Analytics, visit the official website.\n",

Then the init-ssl.sh script is copied into the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ directory to be executed upon initialization.\n\nCertificate expiry\n\nBy default, the cert expiry is set to 820 days. You can control this by configuring the SSL_CERT_DAYS environment variable as needed.\n\nCertificate renewal\n\nWhen a redeploy or restart is done the certificates expiry is checked, if it has expired or will expire in 30 days a new certificate is automatically generated.\n\nA note about ports\n\nBy default, this image is hardcoded to listen on port 5432 regardless of what is set in the PGPORT environment variable. We did this to allow connections to the postgres service over the RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT.  If you need to change this behavior, feel free to build your own image without passing the --port parameter to the CMD command in the Dockerfile.\n\nMoving from timescaledb to duckdb\n\nIf you are moving from timescaledb to duckdb, you will need update the source image of your service and then run the following SQL commands to enable duckdb:\n\nDROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;\n\nALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_duckdb';\n\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_duckdb;",

It was developed by Facebook and is designed to facilitate the creation of documentation websites for software projects in a way that is simple and scalable.\n\nFeatures and Benefits\n\nStatic Page Generation\n   Docusaurus creates websites using static page generation, meaning that the pages are generated at the build time rather than at the request time. This has benefits for performance and security.\n   \nMarkdown\n   It allows writing documentation using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is easy to write and read.\n\nInternationalization (i18n)\n   Docusaurus has built-in support for internationalization, facilitating the translation of your documentation into various languages.\n\nVersioning\n   Docusaurus facilitates the versioning of your documentation, allowing different versions of your documentation to be available and easily accessible.\n\nIntegration with React\n   Docusaurus is built on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This allows great flexibility and power when customizing and extending your website.\n\nSearch\n   Docusaurus integrates a search function (often using Algolia DocSearch) to help users find the information they are looking for more quickly.\n\nStyles and Themes\n   Docusaurus allows you to customize the style and appearance of your documentation website with themes and style sheets.\n\nDocusaurus is widely used in the software development world and is an excellent choice for projects that need a simple and effective way to create and maintain documentation.\n",

    readme:
      "\n  \n\n\n\n    Vector Search Engine for the next generation of AI applications\n\n\nQdrant (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database.\nIt provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points—vectors with an additional payload\nQdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.\n\nQdrant is written in Rust 🦀, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See benchmarks.\n\nWith Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!\n\nFeatures\n\nFiltering and Payload\n\nQdrant can attach any JSON payloads to vectors, allowing for both the storage and filtering of data based on the values in these payloads.\nPayload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more.\n\nFiltering conditions can be combined in various ways, including should, must, and must_not clauses,\nensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching.\n\nHybrid Search with Sparse Vectors\n\nTo address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones.\n\nSparse vectors can be viewed as an generalization of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively.\n\nVector Quantization and On-Disk Storage\n\nQdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient.\nBuilt-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision.\n\nDistributed Deployment\n\nQdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms:\nSize expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication\nZero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections\n\nHighlighted Features\n\nQuery Planning and Payload Indexes - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy.\nSIMD Hardware Acceleration - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance.\nAsync I/O - uses io_uring to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage.\nWrite-Ahead Logging - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages.\n\nAPI\n\nREST\n\nOnline OpenAPI 3.0 documentation is available here.\nOpenAPI makes it easy to generate a client for virtually any framework or programming language.\n\nYou can also download raw OpenAPI definitions.\n\ngRPC\n\nFor faster production-tier searches, Qdrant also provides a gRPC interface. You can find gRPC documentation here.\n\nClients\n\nQdrant offers the following client libraries to help you integrate it into your application stack with ease:\n\nOfficial:\n  Go client\n  Rust client\n  JavaScript/TypeScript client\n  Python client\n  .NET/C# client\n  Java client\nCommunity:\n  Elixir\n  PHP\n  Ruby\n  Java\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nQuick Start Guide\nEnd to End Colab Notebook demo with SentenceBERT and Qdrant\nDetailed Documentation are great starting points\nStep-by-Step Tutorial to create your first neural network project with Qdrant",

      'Letta\n\n👾 Letta is an open source framework for building stateful LLM applications. You can use Letta to build stateful agents with advanced reasoning capabilities and transparent long-term memory. The Letta framework is white box and model-agnostic.\n\nFor more information see: https://github.com/letta-ai/letta\n\nUsage\n\nFor a tutorial on how to deploy a Letta server on Railway, see our docs page: https://docs.letta.com/guides/server/railway\n\nDeploy the Railway template.\nTo use the Letta ADE, go to https://app.letta.com and connect to a remote development server. Use the IP address exposed by Railway as the server URL, and use the password set in the "Variables" section of your Railway deployment.\nThe Letta server will need to be configured with at least one LLM API provider, to do so set your environment variables (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY) in the "Variables" section.\n\nAdding additional environment variables\n\nTo help you get started, when you deploy the template you have the option to fill in the example environment variables OPENAI_API_KEY (to connect your Letta agents to GPT models), ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (to connect your Letta agents to Claude models), and COMPOSIO_API_KEY (to connect your Letta agents to Composio\'s library of over 7k pre-made tools).\n\nThere are many more providers you can enable on the Letta server via additional environment variables (for example vLLM, Ollama, etc). For more information on available providers, see our documentation: https://docs.letta.com/guides/server/docker\n\nTo connect Letta to an additional API provider, you can go to your Railway deployment (after you\'ve deployed the template), click Variables to see the current environment variables, then click + New Variable to add a new variable. Once you\'ve saved a new variable, you will need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.',

    readme:
      "LaunchPad: The new Official Strapi Demo App\nLaunchPad isn’t just an upgrade to Strapi 5 and Nextjs 14 —it’s a complete redesign of the frontend with TailwindCSS and Aceternity. Built with a cleaner structure and more modern UI components LaunchPad gives you a great overview of what using Strapi looks and feels like for backend, frontend development and content management. Whether you're new to Strapi or have been using it for a while, LaunchPad will help you better understand how Strapi can adapt to fit projects of all sizes.\n\nWhat LaunchPad Offers and How It Improves on FoodAdvisor\nLaunchPad is packed with essential features to help you explore Strapi, along with several key improvements over FoodAdvisor. Here’s what you can expect:\n\nWhat’s Included in LaunchPad:\nPre-configured Strapi setup: LaunchPad is ready to use out of the box, with everything you need to get started, from content creation to API interactions.\nComplete content workflows: It comes with built-in demonstrations of Strapi’s collection and single types, components, dynamic zones, internationalization (i18n), and media library. Everything is pre-configured so you can explore without any extra setup.\nRole-based access control (RBAC): Manage user permissions with ease, simulating how you would control access in a real-world application.\nInternationalization (i18n): Create and manage content in multiple languages and regions, with pre-configured examples to show you how it works in practice.\nWhat’s Improved Over FoodAdvisor:\nNew Strapi 5 Features: LaunchPad introduces key updates like Content History, letting you easily track changes and revert to previous versions of your content. The upgraded Draft & Publish system allows for smoother content management—work on drafts and only publish when everything’s ready. These tools give you more control over your workflow, making revisions and publishing simpler.\nRebuilt Next.js Application: We've reworked the demo app using the Aceternity UI to show what a Strapi-powered site can really do. In collaboration with Manu Arora, founder of Aceternity , we built a brand-new frontend with a theme that better reflects Strapi today. This custom app connects seamlessly with Strapi to power the new official Strapi 5 demo.\n100% TypeScript: Unlike FoodAdvisor which is full JavaScript, LaunchPad is fully written in TypeScript as it's based on Strapi 5 which has moved from being written in plain JavaScript to being almost entirely TypeScript.\nThese updates make LaunchPad a more powerful, flexible, and practical demo for developers who want to see Strapi’s full capabilities in action.\n\nAnd the best part is that it's fully open source. Check out the LaunchPad repository on GitHub and feel free to give it a ⭐ if you like what you see!",

Update Turborepo Configuration 📝\n\nTime to modify your code to use the remote cache, but trust me, it\'s easy.  \nSet the following environment variables that you copied from the Railway project we just deployed:\n\nWhen deploying your code on the same Railway project as this template, you can use ${{"Turborepo Remote Cache".TURBO_TOKEN}}\nTURBO_TOKEN={TURBO_TOKEN}\nWhen deploying your code on the same Railway project as this template, you can use ${{"Turborepo Remote Cache".TURBO_API_URL}}\nTURBO_API={TURBO_API_URL}\nLeave this as is\nTURBO_TEAM=railway-remote-cache\n\nAnd in case you prefer .env file instead of filling out those env variables in your shell everytime, you can use the dotenv-cli package.  \nModify the build script in your package.json root to include the following:\n\ndotenv -e .env -- turbo build\n\n4. Use Remote Cache 🎉\n\nRun your Turborepo commands as normal. The remote cache will be automatically utilized:\n\nturbo build\nYou can verify the remote cache is working by checking your Turborepo build logs. When successful, you\'ll see:\n\nRemote caching enabled\n\nTroubleshooting 🔍\n\nCommon Issues\nVerify Railway deployment is running and accessible\nDouble-check that your token and API URL are correctly configured\nTest the setup using the example reference project to validate configuration and rule out any potential template-specific issues\n\nNeed More Help?\nJoin Railway\'s Discord community for additional support and troubleshooting.

It is designed for straightforward configuration, enabling a quick connection between a PostgreSQL database and Meilisearch without extra dependencies like an admin-dashboard or Redis for progress tracking.\n\nKey Features:\nConfigurable Setup: Modify the configuration file located at /sync/config.yml in GitHub to adjust synchronization parameters for specific data and indexing needs.\nIndexing with Meilisearch: Ensures that the target index is created and synchronized in the connected Meilisearch service or instance using Meilisync\nDatabase Compatibility: Includes PostgreSQL pre-requisites, based on Railways PostgreSQL 16 with SSL Template\nBring Your Own Meilisearch Instance: This template requires an existing Meilisearch instance, so users will need to connect their own service.\n\nSetup Instructions:\nConfigure: Follow the setup instructions from Meilisync's GitHub repository to configure and verify the setup.\n\nVerify: Ensure that the required table exists in PostgreSQL and that /sync/config.yml is correctly configured for synchronization requirements. You might get a strange error & service crash if this is not done.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more details on using templates and deploying services on Railway, see Railway's Documentation. To modify the config.yml file for Meilisync, consider ejecting the repository under settings.\n\nThis template is a straightforward setup for synchronizing PostgreSQL data with Meilisearch while utilizing Railway’s deployment infrastructure.

It supports both local and remote databases, making it flexible for various application needs. With a minimalistic API and seamless integration into Deno, DenoKV is ideal for projects requiring fast and efficient data storage.\n\nHow to Connect with a Custom URL\n\nTo connect to a DenoKV instance using a custom URL, use the following example:\n\n// Connect to the DenoKV instance using a custom URL\nconst kv = await Deno.openKv("http://denokv.railway.internal");\n\n// Set a value with the specified key\nawait kv.set(["key"], "value");\n\n// Retrieve and log the value associated with the key\nconsole.log(await kv.get(["key"])); // Output: value\n\nPublic Access on Railway\n\nNote: To make your DenoKV instance publicly accessible, you need to add a custom domain on Railway. This step ensures external applications can interact with your DenoKV instance. You can configure this by setting up a custom domain within your Railway project settings and pointing it to your DenoKV service. This allows for easy public access to your database via the provided URL.',

    description: "Webhook payload delivery service",
    readme:
      "Usage\n\nSmee is a webhook payload delivery service - it receives webhook payloads, and sends them to listening clients. You can generate a new channel by visiting deployed url, and get a unique URL to send payloads to.\n\nHeads up! Smee.io is intended for use in development, not for production. It's a way to inspect payloads through a UI and receive them on a local machine, not as a proxy for production applications.\n\nHow it works\n\nSmee works with two components: the public self-hosted website and the smee-client. They talk to each other via Server-Sent Events, a type of connection that allows for messages to be sent from a source to any clients listening.\n\nThis means that channels are just an abstraction - all Smee does is get a payload and sends it to any actively connected clients.\n\nDeploying your own Smee.io\n\nSmee.io is a simple Node.js application. You can deploy it with this template!\n\nDon't forget to point smee-client to your instance of smee.io:\n\nsmee --url https://your-smee.up.railway.app/channel\n\nFAQ\n\nHow long do channels live for?\n\nChannels are always active - once a client is connected, Smee will send any payloads it gets at /:channel to those clients.\n\nShould I use this in production?\n\nNo! Smee is not designed for production use - it is a development and testing tool. Note that channels are not authenticated, so if someone has your channel ID they can see the payloads being sent, so it is not secure for production use.\n\nAre payloads ever stored?\n\nWebhook payloads are never stored on the server, or in any database; the Smee.io server is simply a pass-through. However, we do store payloads in localStorage in your browser, so that revisiting https://smee.io/:channel will persist the payloads you saw there last.",

Example: 0 5 * * *\n\nAWS_S3_ENDPOINT - The S3 custom endpoint you want to use. Applicable for 3-rd party S3 services such as Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze R2.\n\nAWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE - Use path style for the endpoint instead of the default subdomain style, useful for MinIO. Default false\n\nRUN_ON_STARTUP - Run a backup on startup of this application then proceed with making backups on the set schedule.\n\nBACKUP_FILE_PREFIX - Add a prefix to the file name.\n\nBUCKET_SUBFOLDER - Define a subfolder to place the backup files in.\n\nSINGLE_SHOT_MODE - Run a single backup on start and exit when completed. Useful with the platform's native CRON schedular.\n\nSUPPORT_OBJECT_LOCK - Enables support for buckets with object lock by providing an MD5 hash with the backup file.\n",

    description: "g1: Using Llama-3.1 70b on Groq to create o1-like reasoning chains",
    readme:
      "g1: Using Llama-3.1 70b on Groq to create o1-like reasoning chains\n\nThis is an early prototype of using prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning capabilities through o1-like reasoning chains. This allows the LLM to \"think\" and solve logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. Unlike o1, all the reasoning tokens are shown, and the app uses an open source model.\n\ng1 is experimental and being open sourced to help inspire the open source community to develop new strategies to produce o1-like reasoning. This experiment helps show the power of prompting reasoning in visualized steps, not a comparison to or full replication of o1, which uses different techniques. OpenAI's o1 is instead trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using Chain of Thought, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex PhD-level problems. \n\ng1 demonstrates the potential of prompting alone to overcome straightforward LLM logic issues like the Strawberry problem, allowing existing open source models to benefit from dynamic reasoning chains and an improved interface for exploring them.\n\nHow it works\n\ng1 powered by Llama3.1-70b creates reasoning chains, in principle a dynamic Chain of Thought, that allows the LLM to \"think\" and solve some logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models.\n\nAt each step, the LLM can choose to continue to another reasoning step, or provide a final answer. Each step is titled and visible to the user. The system prompt also includes tips for the LLM. There is a full explanation under Prompt Breakdown, but a few examples are asking the model to “include exploration of alternative answers” and “use at least 3 methods to derive the answer”.\n\nThe reasoning ability of the LLM is therefore improved through combining Chain-of-Thought with the requirement to try multiple methods, explore alternative answers, question previous draft solutions, and consider the LLM’s limitations. This alone, without any training, is sufficient to achieve ~70% accuracy on the Strawberry problem (n=10, \"How many Rs are in strawberry?\"). Without prompting, Llama-3.1-70b had 0% accuracy and ChatGPT-4o had 30% accuracy.\n\nExamples\n\n&gt; !IMPORTANT]\n&gt; g1 is not perfect, but it can perform significantly better than LLMs out-of-the-box. From initial testing, g1 accurately solves simple logic problems 60-80% of the time that usually stump LLMs. However, accuracy has yet to be formally evaluated. See examples below.\n\nHow many Rs are in strawberry?\nPrompt: How many Rs are in strawberry?\n\nResult:\n\nStrawberry example\n\nPrompt: Which is larger, .9 or .11?\n\nResult:\n\n0.9 or 0.11 example\n\nPrompting Strategy\n\nThe prompt is as follows:\n\nYou are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step. For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer. Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys. USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO. IN YOUR REASONING, INCLUDE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS. CONSIDER YOU MAY BE WRONG, AND IF YOU ARE WRONG IN YOUR REASONING, WHERE IT WOULD BE. FULLY TEST ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES. YOU CAN BE WRONG. WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING, ACTUALLY RE-EXAMINE, AND USE ANOTHER APPROACH TO DO SO. DO NOT JUST SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING. USE AT LEAST 3 METHODS TO DERIVE THE ANSWER. USE BEST PRACTICES.\n\nExample of a valid JSON response:\njson\n{\n    \"title\": \"Identifying Key Information\",\n    \"content\": \"To begin solving this problem, we need to carefully examine the given information and identify the crucial elements that will guide our solution process. This involves...\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\nBreakdown\n\nFirst, a persona is added:\n\n&gt; You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step.\n\n\n\nThen, instructions to describe the expected step-by-step reasoning process while titling each reasoning step. This includes the ability for the LLM to decide if another reasoning step is needed or if the final answer can be provided.\n\n&gt; For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer. \n\n\n\nJSON formatting is introduced with an example provided later.\n\n&gt; Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys. \n\n\n\nIn all-caps to improve prompt compliance by emphasizing the importance of the instruction, a set of tips and best practices are included.\n\nUse as many reasoning steps as possible. At least 3. -&gt; This ensures the LLM actually takes the time to think first, and results usually in about 5-10 steps.\nBe aware of your limitations as an llm and what you can and cannot do. -&gt; This helps the LLM remember to use techniques which produce better results, like breaking \"strawberry\" down into individual letters before counting.\nInclude exploration of alternative answers. Consider you may be wrong, and if you are wrong in your reasoning, where it would be. -&gt; A large part of the gains seem to come from the LLM re-evaluating its initial response to ensure it logically aligns with the problem.\nWhen you say you are re-examining, actually re-examine, and use another approach to do so. Do not just say you are re-examining. -&gt; This encourages the prevention of the LLM just saying it re-examined a problem without actually trying a new approach. \nUse at least 3 methods to derive the answer. -&gt; This helps the LLM come to the right answer by trying multiple methods to derive it.\nUse best practices. -&gt; This is as simple as the \"Do better\" prompts which improve LLM code output. By telling the LLM to use best practices, or do better, it generally performs better!\n\n\n&gt; USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO. IN YOUR REASONING, INCLUDE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS. CONSIDER YOU MAY BE WRONG, AND IF YOU ARE WRONG IN YOUR REASONING, WHERE IT WOULD BE. FULLY TEST ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES. YOU CAN BE WRONG. WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING, ACTUALLY RE-EXAMINE, AND USE ANOTHER APPROACH TO DO SO. DO NOT JUST SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING. USE AT LEAST 3 METHODS TO DERIVE THE ANSWER. USE BEST PRACTICES.\n\n\n\nFinally, after the problem is added as a user message, an assistant message is loaded to provide a standardized starting point for the LLM's generation.\n\n&gt; Assistant: Thank you! I will now think step by step following my instructions, starting at the beginning after decomposing the problem\n\nTop Forks\nMult1: Using multiple AI providers to create o1-like reasoning chains ([GitHub Repository)\n\nCredits\n\nThis app was developed by Benjamin Klieger.",

The IP associated with a given domain can be found by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for the domain's A (address) record.\n\nUse Cases\nFinding the IP of a given server is the first step to conducting further investigations, as it allows us to probe the server for additional info. Including creating a detailed map of a target's network infrastructure, pinpointing the physical location of a server, identifying the hosting service, and even discovering other domains that are hosted on the same IP address.\n\nUseful Links\nUnderstanding IP Addresses\nIP Addresses - Wiki\nRFC-791 Internet Protocol\nwhatismyipaddress.com\n\n\n\nSSL Chain\n\nDescription\nSSL certificates are digital certificates that authenticate the identity of a website or server, enable secure encrypted communication (HTTPS), and establish trust between clients and servers. A valid SSL certificate is required for a website to be able to use the HTTPS protocol, and encrypt user + site data in transit. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third parties that verify the identity and legitimacy of the certificate holder.\n\nUse Cases\nSSL certificates not only provide the assurance that data transmission to and from the website is secure, but they also provide valuable OSINT data. Information from an SSL certificate can include the issuing authority, the domain name, its validity period, and sometimes even organization details. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of a website, understanding its security setup, or even for discovering associated subdomains or other services.\n\nUseful Links\nTLS - Wiki\nWhat is SSL (via Cloudflare learning)\nRFC-8446 - TLS\nSSL Checker\n\n\n\nDNS Records\n\nDescription\nThis task involves looking up the DNS records associated with a specific domain. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Various types of DNS records exist, including A (address), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text), among others.\n\nUse Cases\nExtracting DNS records can provide a wealth of information in an OSINT investigation. For example, A and AAAA records can disclose IP addresses associated with a domain, potentially revealing the location of servers. MX records can give clues about a domain's email provider. TXT records are often used for various administrative purposes and can sometimes inadvertently leak internal information. Understanding a domain's DNS setup can also be useful in understanding how its online infrastructure is built and managed.\n\nUseful Links\nWhat are DNS records? (via Cloudflare learning)\nDNS Record Types\nRFC-1035 - DNS\nDNS Lookup (via MxToolbox)\n\n\n\nCookies\n\nDescription\nThe Cookies task involves examining the HTTP cookies set by the target website. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. They hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, such as site preferences, the state of the user's session, or tracking information.\n\nUse Cases\nCookies can disclose information about how the website tracks and interacts with its users. For instance, session cookies can reveal how user sessions are managed, and tracking cookies can hint at what kind of tracking or analytics frameworks are being used. Additionally, examining cookie policies and practices can offer insights into the site's security settings and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nUseful Links\nHTTP Cookie Docs (Mozilla)\nWhat are Cookies (via Cloudflare Learning)\nTesting for Cookie Attributes (OWASP)\nRFC-6265 - Coolies\n\n\n\nCrawl Rules\n\nDescription\nRobots.txt is a file found (usually) at the root of a domain, and is used to implement the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) to indicate which pages should be ignored by which crawlers and bots. It's good practice to avoid search engine crawlers from over-loading your site, but should not be used to keep pages out of search results (use the noindex meta tag or header instead).\n\nUse Cases\nIt's often useful to check the robots.txt file during an investigation, as it can sometimes disclose the directories and pages that the site owner doesn't want to be indexed, potentially because they contain sensitive information, or reveal the existence of otherwise hidden or unlinked directories. Additionally, understanding crawl rules may offer insights into a website's SEO strategies.\n\nUseful Links\nGoogle Search Docs - Robots.txt\nLearn about robots.txt (via Moz.com)\nRFC-9309 -  Robots Exclusion Protocol\nRobots.txt - wiki\n\n\n\n&gt; You can read more at https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check",

    description: "The API server for ente photos & auth (2fa). ",
    readme:
      '\nOverview\n\nEnte is a fully open-source, end-to-end encrypted platform designed for storing data in the cloud without requiring trust in the service provider. Built on this platform are two apps: Ente Photos (an alternative to Apple and Google Photos) and Ente Auth (a 2FA alternative to the deprecated Authy).\n\nLearn more at ente.io.\n\nConfiguration\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\nS3 Storage\n\nConfigure the S3 variables S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET, S3_ENDPOINT, S3_BUCKET, and S3_REGION if you want to use Ente Photos. Leave these variables empty if you\'re only planning to use Ente Auth.\n\nCryptographic Keys\n\nFor a quick start, you can leave the ENTE_KEY_ENCRYPTION, ENTE_KEY_HASH, and ENTE_KEY_JWT variables empty, although it\'s recommended to generate new keys. See details here.\n\nVerification Code\n\nCreating an account typically requires confirming it with a verification code sent via email. To complete the verification, you have two options: either set values for the optional variables ENTE_INTERNAL_HARDCODED-OTT_LOCAL-DOMAIN-SUFFIX and ENTE_INTERNAL_HARDCODED-OTT_LOCAL-DOMAIN-VALUE, or retrieve the code from the deployment logs.\n\nClient App\n\nOnce the server is deployed, Railway will automatically generate a public URL listening on port 8080. The URL will look like "https://your-project.up.railway.app". To connect the client app to your server, tap 7 times on the onboarding screen to bring up a page where you can configure this URL as your endpoint. For more details, see here.\n\nCreate an account and use the verification code as described above.\n\nIncrease Storage Quota\n\nBy default, the storage quota is set to 5GB. To increase it to 1TB, go to the Postgres service and view the database under "Data". Navigate to the "users" table, select the user you want to update, and change the following fields:\n\nbonus_id: self-hosted-myself\nstorage: 1099511627776\ntype: ADD_ON_SUPPORT\nvalid_till: 0\n\nShared Albums\n\nYou can enable shared folders with a self-hosted instance. However, for simplicity, this template doesn\'t include that configuration. For more details, see here.',

    readme:
      'Simple Kafka Template\n\nThis template provides a straightforward setup for Kafka and Zookeeper, perfect for small projects with minimal configuration.\n\nHow to setup\nYou can connect to Kafka by using the KAFKA_URL environment variable under the "Kafka Broker" service. After connecting, simply create your topics in your code.\n\nNOTE: Ensuring you check if a topic already exists before attempting to create it.\n\nServices\nKafka Broker: Uses the apache/kafka:latest image.\n\nKafka Broker Environment Variables\nKAFKA_NODE_ID="1"  \n  Defines the broker ID for Kafka. It\'s set to "1" for simplicity. Only change if you have multiple brokers.\n\nKAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES="broker,controller"  \n  Specifies the roles for the Kafka process. It\'s set as both a broker and controller. Leave unchanged unless necessary.\n\nKAFKA_LISTENERS="PLAINTEXT://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093"  \n  Defines the listeners for Kafka. The broker listens on port 9092 and the controller on port 9093. No need to modify these.\n\nKAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS="PLAINTEXT://${{RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:9092"  \n  Advertises the Kafka listener on your private domain at port 9092. This should remain as is for the template to work.\n\nKAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES="CONTROLLER"  \n  Specifies the listener names for the controller. Leave this unchanged.\n\nKAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP="CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT"  \n  Maps the security protocols for the listeners. Default is PLAINTEXT, which is fine for small projects.\n\nKAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS="1@${{RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:9093"  \n  Configures the controller quorum voters. Keep this as is unless working with a more complex setup.\n\nKAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR="1"  \n  Sets the replication factor for the offsets topic. A value of "1" is fine for small-scale use.\n\nKAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR="1"  \n  Defines the replication factor for transaction state logs. Default of "1" is suitable for basic projects.\n\nKAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR="1"  \n  Sets the minimum in-sync replicas for transaction state logs. Keep it at "1" for simplicity.\n\nKAFKA_GROUP_INITIAL_REBALANCE_DELAY_MS="0"  \n  Configures the initial rebalance delay for consumer groups. Default is "0", which is appropriate for most cases.\n\nKAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS="3"  \n  Sets the number of partitions for topics. The default is "3", which provides a balanced setup for most small projects.\n\nNote:  \nIt\'s recommended not to change these environment variables unless you are familiar with Kafka configurations.\n\nBy: Bello Shehu Ango  \nEmail: angobello0@gmail.com  \nGitHub: github.com/BelloAngo\n',

By integrating a headless CMS natively into the Next.js environment, it creates a cohesive development experience, much like WordPress did for PHP, but with cutting-edge technology.\n\n&gt; ⚠️ Warning: This template is regularly updated to align with the official releases from the Payload team. Consequently, new updates may introduce breaking changes that could impact the database schema. Users of this template may need to reset their database and execute the new migrations to update the schema accordingly.\n\nThis template is ideal if you are working on:\n\nA personal or enterprise-grade website, blog, or portfolio\nA content publishing platform with a fully-featured publication workflow\nA lead generation website with premium content gated behind authentication\n\nPayload 3 Dashboard\n\nThis template, configured to be hosted on Railway includes a beautifully designed, production-ready front end built with Next.js App Router, served alongside your Payload app in a single instance. This setup allows you to deploy both your backend and website where you need them. In order to make this stack whole, we are using PostgreSQL as the database and MinIO S3 for media storage.\n\nCore features:\n\nNext.js 15 (App Router)\nReact 19 &amp; React Compiler\nPostgreSQL database\nMinIO S3 for media storage\nTypeScript\nReact Hook Form\nPayload Admin Bar\nTailwindCSS styling\nshadcn/ui components\nAuthentication\nFully-featured blog\nPublication workflow\nUser accounts\nDark mode\nPre-made layout building blocks\nSEO\nRedirects\nLive preview\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo get started with using your newly deployed Payload 3 stack, you will need to set up your S3 bucket and configure it's associated environment variables. The variables you will need are S3_BUCKET, S3_ACCESS_KEY, and S3_SECRET_KEY.\n\n\n\nIn order to get these values, you will need to log into your S3 console. The username and password for the S3 console are automatically generated during deployment. You can find these values among your console's environment variables.\n\nOnce logged in, you will need to create a new bucket and generate a new access and secret key. Once you have these values, head back to your project's environment, open up your Payload instance, and replace your obtained values with the existing ones.\n\n🎉 Congradulations! You are now ready to start using your Payload 3 stack. Open up your project's URL, create your admin account, and click the \"Seed\" button to populate your database with some example data.\n\n\n\nYou can find the source code here.\nLeave a ⭐ if you like this project.\n",

Getting an Auth Key\n\nThe Auth key will authenticate the Tailscale machine that we'll deploy into our Railway project in a later step.\n\nHead over to the Keys page located within the settings menu on the Tailscale dashboard.\n\nClick Generate auth key.\n\n    Put in a description and leave all other settings as the default.\n\nClick Generate key.\n\n    Tailscale will now show you the newly generated auth key, be sure to copy it down.\n\nClick Done.\n\n2. Configure Split DNS\n\nProperly configuring our nameserver in Tailscale is essential for enabling local DNS lookups for our private domains.\n\nOpen the DNS page.\n\nUnder the Nameservers Header, click Add Nameserver → Click Custom.\n\n    This is where we'll tell Tailscale how to route the DNS lookups for our railway.internal domains.\n\nEnter fd12::10 as the Nameserver.\n\n    This DNS nameserver is used across all private networks in every environment and will handle our DNS queries for private domains.\n\nEnable the Restrict to domain option, AKA Split DNS.\n\nEnter in railway.internal as our domain.\n\n    This makes sure only DNS lookups for our private domain are forwarded to the private DNS resolver.\n\nClick Save.\n\n3. Deploy the Tailscale Subnet Router\n\nThis will be the gateway into our environment's private network.\n\nOpen the project that contains the services you want to access privately.\n\n    For this tutorial, we will deploy the Subnet Router into a project with a Postgres database service.\n\nIn the top right of the project canvas, click Create → Choose Template.\n\nSearch for the Tailscale Subnet Router template.\n\n    Choose the result that is published by Railway Templates.\n\nA ghost service will appear, Paste in your Auth Key from earlier.\n\nClick Deploy Template\n\nThis template will start to deploy and once deployed it will register itself as a machine in your tailnet with the name automatically derived from the project's name and environment name.\n\n4. Approve the Subnet\n\nOur subnet router will advertise the private network's CIDR range but we will need to manually approve it.\n\nHead back over to our Machines dashboard.\n\nYou will see your newly deployed machine with its name that was previously derived from the project and environment.\n\nClick on the machine's 3-dot menu → Edit route settings.\n\nClick the radio button on the fd12::/16 to accept it.\n\n    This route covers the entire private networking range allowing us to access all services within the project.\n\nClick Save.\n\nThat is it for all the configurations needed, you can now call any service via its private domain and port just as if you were another service within the private network!",

Data model-driven\n\nMost form-, table-, or process-driven no-code products create data structures directly in the user interface, such as Airtable, where adding a new column to a table is adding a new field. This has the advantage of simplicity of use, but the disadvantage of limited functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of more complex scenarios.\n\nNocoBase adopts the design idea of separating the data structure from the user interface, allowing you to create any number of blocks (data views) for the data collections, with different type, styles, content, and actions in each block. This balances the simplicity of no-code operation with the flexibility of native development.\n\nmodel\n\n2. What you see is what you get\n\nNocoBase enables the development of complex and distinctive business systems, but this does not mean that complex and specialized operations are required. With a single click, configuration options are displayed on the usage interface, and administrators with system configuration privileges can directly configure the user interface in a WYSIWYG manner.\n\nwysiwyg\n\n3.

      "\n  Postgres for Search and Analytics \n\n\n\n  Website \n  Docs \n  Community \n  Blog \n  Changelog\n\n\nPublish ParadeDB Artifact Hub Docker Pulls License\nSlack URL\nX URL\n\nParadeDB is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. We're modernizing the features of Elasticsearch's product suite, starting with real-time search and analytics.\n\nStatus\n\nParadeDB is currently in Public Beta. Star and watch this repository to get notified of updates.\n\nRoadmap\n\nx] Search\n  [x] Full-text search with BM25 with [pg_search\n  x] Dense and sparse vector search with [pgvector\n  x] Hybrid search\n[ ] Analytics\n  [x] An analytical query engine over data in Postgres or in any object store or table format with [pg_analytics\n   ] Column-oriented table access method for fast analytics inside Postgres\n  [ ] High-volume data/Kafka ingest\n[x] Self-Hosted ParadeDB\n  [x] Docker image based on [Postgres (see deployment instructions)\n  x] Kubernetes Helm chart based on [CloudNativePG (see deployment instructions)\nx] Specialized Workloads\n  [ ] Support for geospatial data with [PostGIS\n  x] Support for cron jobs with [pg_cron\n  x] Support for basic incremental view maintenance (IVM) via [pg_ivm\n\nGet Started\n\nTo get started, please visit our documentation.\n\nDeploying ParadeDB\n\nParadeDB and its extensions are available as commercial software for installation on self-hosted Postgres deployment and via Docker and Kubernetes as standalone images. For more information, including enterprise features and support, please contact us by email.\n\nExtensions\n\nYou can find prebuilt binaries for all ParadeDB extensions on Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 for Postgres 14, 15 and 16 in the GitHub Releases. We officially support Postgres 12 and above, and you can compile the extensions for other versions of Postgres by following the instructions in the respective extension's README.\n\nDocker Image\n\nTo quickly get a ParadeDB instance up and running, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:\n\ndocker run --name paradedb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password paradedb/paradedb\n\nThis will start a ParadeDB instance with default user postgres and password password. You can then connect to the database using psql:\n\ndocker exec -it paradedb psql -U postgres\n\nTo install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, we recommend using our docker-compose.yml file. Alternatively, you can pass the appropriate environment variables to the docker run command, replacing the &lt;&gt; with your desired values:\n\ndocker run \\\n  --name paradedb \\\n  -e POSTGRES_USER= \\\n  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD= \\\n  -e POSTGRES_DB= \\\n  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/ \\\n  -p 5432:5432 \\\n  -d \\\n  paradedb/paradedb:latest\n\nThis will start a ParadeDB instance with non-root user ` and password . The -v flag enables your ParadeDB data to persist across restarts in a Docker volume named paradedb_data`.\n\nYou can then connect to the database using psql:\n\ndocker exec -it paradedb psql -U  -d  -p 5432 -W\n\nParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to help us understand how many people are using the project. You can opt out of telemetry using configuration variables within Postgres:\n\nALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_search_telemetry TO 'off';\nALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_analytics_telemetry TO 'off';\n\nHelm Chart\n\nParadeDB is also available for Kubernetes via our Helm chart. You can find our Helm chart in the ParadeDB Helm Chart GitHub repository or download it directly from Artifact Hub.\n\nParadeDB Cloud\n\nAt the moment, ParadeDB is not available as a managed cloud service. If you are interested in a ParadeDB Cloud service, please let us know by joining our waitlist.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you're missing a feature or have found a bug, please open a\nGitHub Issue.\n\nTo get community support, you can:\n\nPost a question in the ParadeDB Slack Community\nAsk for help on our GitHub Discussions\n\nIf you need commercial support, please contact the ParadeDB team.\n\nContributing\n\nWe welcome community contributions, big or small, and are here to guide you along\nthe way. To get started contributing, check our first timer issues\nor message us in the ParadeDB Community Slack. Once you contribute, ping us in Slack and we'll send you some ParadeDB swag!\n\nFor more information on how to contribute, please see our\nContributing Guide.\n\nThis project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.\nBy participating in this project, you agree to follow its terms.\n\nThank you for helping us make ParadeDB better for everyone :heart:.\n\nLicense\n\nParadeDB is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 and as commercial software.

    readme:
      "QStash NextJS publisher and handler\n\nThis template shows you how to build a QStash queue handler, and provides a simple type-safe wrapper to build and publish messages to queues.\n\nThe way Upstash's QStash works is that it lets you publish to a queue, then QStash will handle sending that payload to a specified URL of your choosing. This is then part of the request payload. We use Next.js as the backend here to process the messages, as well as provide an example of how to publish a message to a queue. Everything is serialized/deserialized with SuperJSON, and validated with zod.\n\nThe result is that you only have to build out a handler that lets you process a message, and you get the rest for free. You specify the payload you're expecting, and you'll get a type-safe async function to do your work in processing the message.\n\nThis project was initialized with  T3 Stack bootstrapped with create-t3-app. Please read more about their documentation and generally about Next.js if you're curious.\n\nQuick Start\n\nCreate a project on Upstash and associate all of the correct variables.\nCreate a Queue in the QStash tab with the name of the queue(s) in src/app/_services/QStash/types.ts. If you want to see messages immediately, create a queue named process-post so you can test it out.\nOpen the home page of the deployed Next.js app and click the button. You should see that the message shows up in QStash, then you should see logs in your deployment logs for processing the message.\n\nYou can now extend this to handle all of your background work super simply. No more setup required!\n",

    description: "CORS Anywhere is a NodeJS reverse proxy.",
    readme:
      "Build Status\nCoverage Status\n\nCORS Anywhere is a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.\n\nThe url to proxy is literally taken from the path, validated and proxied. The protocol\npart of the proxied URI is optional, and defaults to \"http\". If port 443 is specified,\nthe protocol defaults to \"https\".\n\nThis package does not put any restrictions on the http methods or headers, except for\ncookies. Requesting user credentials is disallowed.\nThe app can be configured to require a header for proxying a request, for example to avoid\na direct visit from the browser.\n\nExample\n\n// Listen on a specific host via the HOST environment variable\nvar host = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';\n// Listen on a specific port via the PORT environment variable\nvar port = process.env.PORT || 8080;\n\nvar cors_proxy = require('cors-anywhere');\ncors_proxy.createServer({\n    originWhitelist: ], // Allow all origins\n    requireHeader: ['origin', 'x-requested-with'],\n    removeHeaders: ['cookie', 'cookie2']\n}).listen(port, host, function() {\n    console.log('Running CORS Anywhere on ' + host + ':' + port);\n});\nRequest examples:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/http://google.com/ - Google.com with CORS headers\nhttp://localhost:8080/google.com - Same as previous.\nhttp://localhost:8080/google.com:443 - Proxies https://google.com/\nhttp://localhost:8080/ - Shows usage text, as defined in lib/help.txt\nhttp://localhost:8080/favicon.ico - Replies 404 Not found\n\nLive examples:\n\nhttps://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/\nhttps://robwu.nl/cors-anywhere.html - This demo shows how to use the API.\n\nDocumentation\n\nClient\n\nTo use the API, just prefix the URL with the API URL. Take a look at [demo.html for an example.\nA concise summary of the documentation is provided at lib/help.txt.\n\nNote: as of February 2021, access to the demo server requires an opt-in,\nsee: https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/301\n\nIf you want to automatically enable cross-domain requests when needed, use the following snippet:\n\n(function() {\n    var cors_api_host = 'cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com';\n    var cors_api_url = 'https://' + cors_api_host + '/';\n    var slice = ].slice;\n    var origin = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host;\n    var open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;\n    XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function() {\n        var args = slice.call(arguments);\n        var targetOrigin = /^https?:\\/\\/(+)/i.exec(args[1]);\n        if (targetOrigin &amp;&amp; targetOrigin[0].toLowerCase() !== origin &amp;&amp;\n            targetOrigin[1] !== cors_api_host) {\n            args[1] = cors_api_url + args[1];\n        }\n        return open.apply(this, args);\n    };\n})();\n\nIf you're using jQuery, you can also use the following code instead of the previous one:\n\njQuery.ajaxPrefilter(function(options) {\n    if (options.crossDomain &amp;&amp; jQuery.support.cors) {\n        options.url = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/' + options.url;\n    }\n});\n\nServer\n\nThe module exports createServer(options), which creates a server that handles\nproxy requests. The following options are supported:\n\nfunction getProxyForUrl - If set, specifies which intermediate proxy to use for a given URL.\n  If the return value is void, a direct request is sent. The default implementation is\n  [proxy-from-env, which respects the standard proxy\n  environment variables (e.g. https_proxy, no_proxy, etc.).  \narray of strings originBlacklist - If set, requests whose origin is listed are blocked.  \n  Example: 'https://bad.example.com', 'http://bad.example.com']\narray of strings originWhitelist - If set, requests whose origin is not listed are blocked.  \n  If this list is empty, all origins are allowed.\n  Example: ['https://good.example.com', 'http://good.example.com']\nfunction handleInitialRequest - If set, it is called with the request, response and a parsed\n  URL of the requested destination (null if unavailable). If the function returns true, the request\n  will not be handled further. Then the function is responsible for handling the request.\n  This feature can be used to passively monitor requests, for example for logging (return false).\nfunction checkRateLimit - If set, it is called with the origin (string) of the request. If this\n  function returns a non-empty string, the request is rejected and the string is send to the client.\nboolean redirectSameOrigin - If true, requests to URLs from the same origin will not be proxied but redirected.\n  The primary purpose for this option is to save server resources by delegating the request to the client\n  (since same-origin requests should always succeed, even without proxying).\narray of strings requireHeader - If set, the request must include this header or the API will refuse to proxy.  \n  Recommended if you want to prevent users from using the proxy for normal browsing.  \n  Example: ['Origin', 'X-Requested-With'].\narray of lowercase strings removeHeaders - Exclude certain headers from being included in the request.  \n  Example: [\"cookie\"]\ndictionary of lowercase strings setHeaders - Set headers for the request (overwrites existing ones).  \n  Example: {\"x-powered-by\": \"CORS Anywhere\"}\nnumber corsMaxAge - If set, an Access-Control-Max-Age request header with this value (in seconds) will be added.  \n  Example: 600 - Allow CORS preflight request to be cached by the browser for 10 minutes.\nstring helpFile - Set the help file (shown at the homepage).  \n  Example: \"myCustomHelpText.txt\"\n\nFor advanced users, the following options are also provided.\n\nhttpProxyOptions - Under the hood, [http-proxy\n  is used to proxy requests. Use this option if you really need to pass options\n  to http-proxy. The documentation for these options can be found here.\nhttpsOptions - If set, a https.Server will be created. The given options are passed to the\n  https.createServer method.\n\nFor even more advanced usage (building upon CORS Anywhere),\nsee the sample code in test/test-examples.js.\n\nDemo server\n\nA public demo of CORS Anywhere is available at https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com. This server is\nonly provided so that you can easily and quickly try out CORS Anywhere. To ensure that the service\nstays available to everyone, the number of requests per period is limited, except for requests from\nsome explicitly whitelisted origins.\n\nNote: as of February 2021, access to the demo server requires an opt-in,\nsee: https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/301\n\nIf you expect lots of traffic, please host your own instance of CORS Anywhere, and make sure that\nthe CORS Anywhere server only whitelists your site to prevent others from using your instance of\nCORS Anywhere as an open proxy.\n\nFor instance, to run a CORS Anywhere server that accepts any request from some example.com sites on\nport 8080, use:\nexport PORT=8080\nexport CORSANYWHERE_WHITELIST=https://example.com,http://example.com,http://example.com:8080\nnode server.js\n\nThis application can immediately be run on Heroku, see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs\nfor instructions. Note that their Acceptable Use Policy forbids\nthe use of Heroku for operating an open proxy, so make sure that you either enforce a whitelist as\nshown above, or severly rate-limit the number of requests.\n\nFor example, to blacklist abuse.example.com and rate-limit everything to 50 requests per 3 minutes,\nexcept for my.example.com and my2.example.com (which may be unlimited), use:\n\nexport PORT=8080\nexport CORSANYWHERE_BLACKLIST=https://abuse.example.com,http://abuse.example.com\nexport CORSANYWHERE_RATELIMIT='50 3 my.example.com my2.example.com'\nnode server.js\n\nLicense\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 - 2021 Rob Wu \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

New features, like new image formats, will work\nwith your front end automatically without any changes.\n\nTo achieve that goal we should keep API to bare minimum and hide the smartness in the implementation. \n\nFeatures\n\nResize/optimises/crops raster (PNG and JPEG) images.\nJpegXL / AVIF / WebP support based on \"Accept\" header.\nVary header support - ready to deploy behind any CDN.\nResponsive images support including high DPI (retina) displays \nSave-Data support\n\nQuickstart\n\nThere is an example of running API behind reverse proxy with integration example in quickstart/ folder.\n\nTo run:\n\ncd quickstart\ndocker-compose up\nopen https://localhost\n\nAPI\n\nThe API has 4 HTTP endpoints:\n\n/img/{IMG_URL}/optimise - optimises image\n/img/{IMG_URL}/resize - resizes image\n/img/{IMG_URL}/fit - resize image to the exact size by resizing and cropping it\n/img/{IMG_URL}/asis - returns original image\n\nDocs:\nSwagger-UI - use API key MjUyMTM3OTQyNw__ which allows to transform any image from unsplash.com\nOpenAPI spec\n\nRunning Locally\n\nDocker\n\nThe latest docker image published on Docker hub\n\nStarting the server:\n\n$ docker run -p 8080:8080 pixboost/transformimgs OPTIONS]\n\nTo verify:\n\nHealth check: curl http://localhost:8080/health\nTransformation: open http://localhost:8080/img/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591769225440-811ad7d6eab3/resize?size=600\n\nOptions\n\nEverything below is optional and have sensible defaults.\n\n| Option | Description | Default |\n|--------|-------------| ------- |\n| cache  | Number of seconds to cache image(0 to disable cache).

      "Piping Server\n\nInfinitely transfer between every device over HTTP/HTTPS\n\nExample usage can be found here.\n\nPiping Server transfers data to POST /hello or PUT /hello into GET /hello. The path /hello can be anything such as /mypath or /mypath/123/. A sender and receivers who specify the same path can transfer. Both the sender and the recipient can start the transfer first. The first one waits for the other. \n\nStream\nThe most important thing is that the data are streamed. This means that you can transfer any data infinitely. \n\nIdeas\nPiping Server is designed based on the ideas as follows.\n\nInfinite transfer: You can transfer any kind of data infinitely on a stream. Streams are very efficient in terms of both time and space.\nZero installation: All you need is to have either a Web browser or curl, which are widely pre-installed. You do not need to install any extra software.\nSimpleness: Making simple makes it more secure.\nStorageless: The server makes transfer more secure since the server never stores your data.\nPurity: The server streams over pure HTTP, which makes integration easier with other softwares.\nEngineer friendly: Also designed for Unix/Linux users, who use pipes, not only for Web browser users.",

    readme:
      "Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + Supabase = Profit!\n\nThis is a project template that sets you up with all of the basics required to build an interesting full stack app. It combines these frameworks into a setup that should empower you to build with sensible defaults.\n\nIt is based on the T3 Stack, bootstrapped with create-t3-app, and then hand-tuned by Bob Ambrose.\n\nThings that this template comes with\n\nNext.js App Router\nPostgres database\nAuth\nType-safe API\nUI library in ShadCN/UI\n\nThis is everything you need to start building an advanced app.\n\nTo be very clear — you get a login page automatically with this template!!\n\nQuick Start\n\nIf you're familiar with these systems, here's your guide to getting going. The short of it is that you need an account with Supabase, and the rest will take care of itself. See .env.example to know what to add; you'll add this to your .env file. See the Supabase Docs for what specifically to do\n\nOnce you do this, you can start the development server with npm run dev and visit localhost:3000 to get started.\n\nOverview\n\nI can't possibly explain the systems better than they explain themselves, but if you're new to any of this tech, I'll do my best to explain the overall picture. But first, some links to each of the projects involved here.\n\nNext.js\nSupabase\nPrisma\ntRPC with TanStack Query\nTailwind CSS with ShadCN UI\n\nGenerally speaking, here's how things click together:\n\nNext.js at its core. This is the web server framework that will return a React app.\ntRPC as the server API. It provides type safety end-to-end at its core. We use this as the main way to talk to the database to make sure we get authorized queries.\n  Note: this template does not take full advantage of Supabase's RLS (row-level security) as an auth strategy. It instead creates\nSupabase as the auth, database, and storage provider.\n\nThis template doesn't enforce an opinion on data fetching strategies, but you do have basically two options\n\nUse the TanStack query hooks from the trpc component to fetch data in the React Lifecycle. This is the pre- React Server Components way to fetch data.\nUse the trpc client to fetch data in React Server Components. You can take full advantage of Suspense and have the first response from the server return interesting HTML.\n\nThere is lengthy debate on what the right approach will be for each use case. I encourage you to think critically about what one is best for you. If you're not sure, try starting with the TanStack query option and try pre-fetching queries in the server component for the page.\n\nYou can see examples in prefetch/page.tsx, server-only-fetch/page.tsx, and client-only-fetch/page.tsx. It's also worth noting that you can pre-fetch data in the initial SSR render of client components too, but I digress.\n",

Even setting up the SES -> SNS -> SQS pipeline is a headache for developers unfamiliar with AWS. And when that is done your still left with hooking in or building custom some dashboard for viewing bounces and all the vital information you care about.\n\n00 provides an SST configuration step to set up the SES -> SNS -> SQS pipeline,\nso you can just run a command and let SST do the rest.\n\nThen 00 provides you that dashboard for viewing the information you care about.\n\nGetting started\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to clone this repo and run sst deploy in it. Make sure to set the EMAIL_IDENTITY env variable first, this will be the email or domain you wish to send from.\n\nUsing SST is easy, and you can find the steps to do so here and learn how to configure your credentials here\n\nIf you would like to avoid using SST you must manually configure AWS.\nYou need to set up a configuration set to write to an SQS queue via SNS. You can configure it however you want, but the more events you send to the queue the more 00 will be able to track (obviously).\n\nMore details: https://github.com/technomancy-dev/00/",

    readme:
      "SKANDHA on Railway with Arbitrum\n\nThis project is a fork of the original etherspot/skandha repository. We would like to acknowledge and thank the original creators for their work and contribution. This fork has been modified to enable hosting on Railway with default settings configured for Arbitrum.\n\nIntroduction\nIn ERC-4337, a Bundler is the core infrastructure component that allows account abstraction to work on any EVM network. On the highest level, its purpose is to work with a mempool of User Operations to get the transaction to be included on-chain.\n\nThis project allows you to deploy the SKANDHA bundler application on Railway with support for Arbitrum. SKANDHA is a platform designed to provide decentralized orchestration for blockchain-based tasks, specifically functioning as a Bundler for ERC-4337.\n\nGetting Started\nFollow these steps to get the project up and running:\n\nFork the Repository: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.\nClone the Repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.\n    git clone https://github.com/voidfab/skandha.git\nDeploy to Railway: Follow the Railway Documentation to deploy the project. Or 1-click deploy:\n\nDeploy on Railway\n\nConfiguration\nBy default, this project is configured to work with Arbitrum. To modify the configuration, edit the necessary environment variables and settings in the railway.toml or config.json (or environment variables directly on Railway Preferred Method).\n\nSkandha Help\nBelow are all the ENV Variables you can set (details can be found in etherspots docs)\nSKANDHA_ENTRYPOINTS=0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789,0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032\nRELAYERS=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80,0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d\nSKANDHA_BENEFICIARY_ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266\nSKANDHA_RPC=\nSKANDHA_RPC_SUBMIT=\nSKANDHA_GAS_PRICE_MARKUP=0\nSKANDHA_ENFORCE_GAS_PRICE=false\nSKANDHA_ENFORCE_GAS_PRICE_THRESHOLD=1000\nSKANDHA_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=\nSKANDHA_RECEIPT_LOOKUP_RANGE=\nSKANDHA_CONDITIONAL_TRANSACTIONS=\nSKANDHA_EIP2930=\nSKANDHA_MIN_STAKE=\nSKANDHA_MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY=\nSKANDHA_BUNDLE_GAS_LIMIT_MARKUP=\nSKANDHA_RELAYING_MODE=\nSKANDHA_BUNDLE_INTERVAL=\nSKANDHA_BUNDLE_SIZE=\nSKANDHA_PVG_MARKUP=\nSKANDHA_CANONICAL_MEMPOOL=\nSKANDHA_CANONICAL_ENTRY_POINT=\nSKANDHA_CGL_MARKUP=\nSKANDHA_VGL_MARKUP=\nSKANDHA_GAS_FEE_IN_SIMULATION=\nSKANDHA_THROTTLING_SLACK=\nSKANDHA_BAN_SLACK=\nSKANDHA_MIN_INCLUSION_DENOMINATOR=\nSKANDHA_MERKLE_API_URL=\nSKANDHA_SKIP_BUNDLE_VALIDATION=\nSKANDHA_BUNDLE_GAS_LIMIT=\nSKANDHA_USEROP_GAS_LIMIT=\nSKANDHA_KOLIBRI_AUTH_KEY=\nSKANDHA_ENTRYPOINT_FORWARDER=\nSKANDHA_FASTLANE_VALIDATOR=\nSKANDHA_ESTIMATION_GAS_LIMIT=\nSKANDHA_PVG_MARKUP_PERCENT=\nSKANDHA_CGL_MARKUP_PERCENT=\nSKANDHA_VGL_MARKUP_PERCENT=\nSKANDHA_WL_PAYMASTER=\nSKANDHA_WL_ACCOUNT=\nSKANDHA_WL_FACTORY=\nPORT=14337\n\nSecurity Considerations\nWhen reading the EIP specs, you'll notice that there are many rules a bundler must follow. Although the list of rules may seem long and complex, each one has been extensively debated and discussed by security researchers and builders within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOne of the bundler's main jobs is to comply with these rules to prevent all possible DoS attack vectors. These include everything from basic sanity checks that make sure a User Operation is structurally sound to more in-depth tracing for banned opcodes and storage access to make sure bundles cannot be censored once submitted to the network.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum clients, all bundler implementations are expected to pass a test suite to ensure compliance and that it won't fragment the mempool.\n\nSpec Tests: https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler-spec-tests\n\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to the original creators of the pimlico/skandha project. This fork wouldn't be possible without their foundational work.\n\nThe ERC-4337 Team and the Ethereum community for their continued support and guidance in the development of the EIP-4337 specification.\n\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

    readme:
      "PostHog Reverse Proxy\n\nhttps://posthog.com/docs/advanced/proxy\n\nA reverse proxy allows you to send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain.\n\nThis means that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers. You'll be able to capture more usage data without having to self-host PostHog.\n\nSetting up a reverse proxy means setting up a service to redirect requests from a subdomain you choose (like e.yourdomain.com) to PostHog. It is best practice to use a subdomain that does not include posthog, analytics, tracking, or other similar words. \n\nYou then use this subdomain as your api_host in the initialization of PostHog instead of us.i.posthog.com or eu.i.posthog.com.\n\nposthog.init('phc_YOUR_TOKEN', {\n  api_host: 'https://e.yourdomain.com'\n})\n\nCustom domain\n\nIt's recommend that you associate this service to a custom domain. If your frontend service is yourdomain.com, make this service e.yourdomain.com.\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\nThis template requires two environment variables, SERVER_NAME and PORT. Both are set by default by the template and don't need to be changed.\n\nSERVER_NAME is set to ${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}\n\nPORT is the port through which Railway will contact this service, by default it's 80 but it pretty much doesn't matter.",

    readme:
      "Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the url and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications.\n\nWebsite\nDocumentation\nGitHub\n\nTips\n\nThe deployment will create a default administrator account with the username changeme@example.com and the password MyPassword . You should login and follow the setup flow to change the username and password.\nCommunication with Postgres is done exclusively over the private network and the database is not exposed externally by default. If you want to enable external access, go to the database settings and enable TCP proxying on port 5432. This can be disabled at any time.\nChanging the Railway-provided domain or adding a custom domain may require redeploying the Mealie service.\nSince Volumes on Railway are still a new feature, there is no option to access or backup the persistent data. However, Mealie natively supports backing up and restoring data via the user interface. These backups can easily be restored on fresh deployments after logging in.\nA complete list of supported environment variables can be found here. These can be added to the Mealie service to enable support for email, LDAP, and/or OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n\nNote: This is a community-made template and therefore not supported by the Mealie team. Please direct help requests to the Railway thread for the template.",

      'The official Mongo image in Docker hub does not come with SSL baked in.\n\nSince this could pose a problem for applications or services attempting to connect to Mongo services, this service has SSL enabled right out of the box.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSelf-signed server certificates are created using a generated root CA. The server\'s CN is set to the MONGOHOST\nvariable. During startup the script will print the root CA private key and certificate so that they can be used to\nverify the server certificate and generate client certificates, as explained below.\n\nAccessing the service\n\nMongo is launched with the preferTLS mode. This means that connections are not required to use TLS and you can\ncontinue to connect to Mongo using the MONGO_URL or MONGO_PRIVATE_URL variables.\n\nIf you would like to use TLS then there are three options:\n\n1. Connect without client certificates\n\nSet the tls and tlsAllowInvalidCertificates (required because of the self-signed server certificate) options when\nconnecting:\n\nmongosh --tls --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates "$MONGO_URL"\nor\nmongosh "$MONGO_URL/?tls=true&tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true"\n\n2. Connect without client certificates but with root CA certificate\n\nWhen starting up the wrapper script will print the generated root CA key and certificate files. You can use them to\nverify the server\'s certificate and/or generate your own.\n\nScroll up in the service logs and copy the text starting with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and ending\nwith -----END CERTIFICATE----- to a file named root.crt.\n\nYou can now verify the server\'s certificate with the tlsCAFile option:\n\nmongosh --tls --tlsCAFile root.crt "$MONGO_URL"\nor\nmongosh "$MONGO_URL/?tls=true&tlsCAFile=root.crt"\n\n3. Connect with client certificates\n\nCreate the root.crt file as explained above. From the service logs copy the text starting\nwith -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and ending\nwith -----END PRIVATE KEY----- to a file named root.key.\n\nGenerate the client certificates (set the SSL_CERT_DAYS environment variable if you want to change the default\ncertificate expiry of 820 days):\n\nopenssl req -new -nodes -text -out "client.csr" -keyout "client.key" -subj "/CN=localhost"\nopenssl x509 -req -in "client.csr" -text -out "client.crt" -CA "root.crt" -CAkey "root.key" -CAcreateserial -days "${SSL_CERT_DAYS:-820}"\ncat "client.key" "client.crt" > "client.pem"\n\nUse the new client.pem file with the tlsCertificateKeyFile option when connecting:\n\nmongosh --tls --tlsCAFile root.crt --tlsCertificateKeyFile client.pem "$MONGO_URL"\nor\nmongosh "$MONGO_URL/?tls=true&tlsCAFile=root.crt&tlsCertificateKeyFile=client.pem"\n\nCustom start command\n\nExtend the current start command if you need to add other arguments to mongo:\n\nwrapper.sh mongod --config=/etc/mongo/mongod.conf --ipv6 --bind_ip=::,0.0.0.0\n\nIf you need a custom config then be sure to copy the current tls parameters found in mongod.conf.\n\nCert expiry\n\nBy default, the cert expiry is set to 820 days. You can control this by configuring the SSL_CERT_DAYS environment\nvariable as needed.\n\nGitHub\n\nDockerfiles can be found at https://github.com/kovalromank/mongo-ssl.\n\nReferences the official Railway postgres-ssl service at https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/postgres-ssl.',

    readme:
      "Hollo is a federated single-user microblogging software powered by Fedify. Although it is for single-user, it is designed to be federated through ActivityPub, which means that you can follow and be followed by other users from other instances, even from other software that supports ActivityPub like Mastodon, Misskey, and so on.\n\nThe Railway is the simplest way to deploy Hollo.  With this template, you can get started with your own Hollo in just a few clicks.\n\nTo deploy Hollo, you need S3 or S3-compatible object storage for storing media such as images. There are many S3-compatible object storage services, including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, and Linode Object Storage. Once you have your object storage ready, you'll need to configure the environment variables below appropriately (see how to use the S3 client API for each service):\n\nS3_BUCKET: The bucket name of the S3-compatible object storage.\nS3_URL_BASE: The public URL base of the S3-compatible object storage.\nS3_ENDPOINT_URL: The endpoint URL for S3-compatible object storage. \nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: The access key for S3-compatible object storage.\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: The secret key for S3-compatible object storage.\n\nOnce you've set up your environment variables and Hollo is deployed on Railway, go to https://yourdomain/setup to set up your login credentials and add your profile.\n\nIt's important to note that you need to decide on a domain name before you start setting up Hollo for the first time. This is because you can't change your domain name once Hollo is set up.\n\nOnce you've created your profile, you're ready to start enjoying Hollo. It's worth noting that Hollo doesn't have much of a web interface of its own, so you'll need to use a client app like Phanpy for now.",

      "Why to use Tolgee?\n\nBeacause it saves a lot of time you would spend on localization tasks without it. Because it enables you to provide perfectly translated software. \n\nFrame 47\n\nIn context translating & One click screenshots\n\nAdd translations in the code, and translate them directly in the app with the Tolgee i18n tool. Clicking an element while holding the ALT/option key opens a dialog where you can simply modify your strings. No need to edit large .json/.po/.whatever file. In-context translating works great also in the production environment.\n\nOnce. That's how many times you have to click to take a screenshot from your application with highlighted phrases to translate. Just ALT + click a string and hit the camera button. Boom! Screenshot generated.\n\nSep-06-2022 16-38-49\n\nTranslating on production\n\nIn-context translating also works in the production environment of your deployed app. Using the Tolgee Tools Chrome plugin, you can simply provide your API key and start translating. This enables anybody without developer knowledge to translate your app.\n\nTrue integrations\n\nTolgee is not just another localization platform offering integrations that just sync your local data with the backend. Tolgee is truly integrated into your app via SDKs.\n\nMachine translation\n\nWe support DeepL, Google Translate, and AWS Translate. Select which services you want to use in the settings section. The machine translation features make the whole localization process significantly faster. Translators can just use translation suggestions provided by third-party machine translation services.\n\nTranslation memory\n\nTolgee automatically makes suggestions from translations you already used in the project so you can translate similar phrases in a similar way.\n\nTranslation memory suggestions also show the similarity percentage, the key, and the original text of the translated string.\n\nAuto translation\n\nWhen enabled, Tolgee automatically translates new keys using translation memory or machine translation services. Your strings are translated immediately, right after creation. Select if you would like to use translation memory and/or which machine translation service you would like to use to automatically translate new keys.\n\nActivity log\n\nSee who modified, reviewed or commented on the phrases in your project. Clearly.\n\nComment on translations\n\nSomething look off? Tell others what you would change. You can comment every translation on Tolgee platform.\n\nTranslation history\n\nSee the changes to specific translations of a specific key in a specific language. Something is wrong?

    readme:
      "Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Target Audience\n\nThis template is intended for everyone interested in deploying Spring Cloud and Spring Boot based microservices architectures.\n\n✨ Features\n\nWith this template you will deploy a fully-fledged Spring Cloud Microservice Ecosystem with the following features:\n\nNetflix Eureka server prepared to register microservices in your architecture.\n HTTP resolution is enabled for testing purposes. We recommend to disable it for a production deployment.\n\nSpring Cloud Gateway instance prepared to fetch data from Netflix Eureka to build the route table for redirections.\n HTTP resolution is enabled.\n If you want to use a complex Spring Cloud Gateway implementation with filters and request translation, use this template.\n\nTwo microservices (empty implementation) ready to be used with Eureka and Cloud Gateway. They expose a dummy endpoint for testing purposes.\n HTTP resolution is disabled so these parts of the architecture are not reachable directly from the Internet.\n\nAfter deployment, you can test the entire ecosystem with the following GET request:\n\ncurl --location 'gateway_public_domain/microservice-one/'\n\nWhere gateway_public_domain is the public domain provided by Railway (something like spring-cloud-gateway-production-XXXX.up.railway.app)\n\n👀 See also\n\nCheck out another templates with each part of this one but separately:\nEureka Server Standalone\nCloud Gateway Straightforward Standalone\nCloud Gateway ACL Standalone\nMicroservice Archetype Standalone\n\n###❓ What is Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka?\n\nSpring Cloud Netflix Eureka is a key tool in the microservices world, offering a robust solution for service discovery. Part of the Spring Cloud ecosystem, it is based on Netflix Eureka. Its main function is to allow services to register in its registry and discover other services through simple queries. This approach facilitates scalability and service management in microservices architectures, where services can vary and change dynamically.\n\nEureka helps developers focus on business logic while the system automatically handles service discovery. This includes load balancing, fault handling, and providing an easy interface for service management. Eureka seamlessly integrates with other Spring Cloud components like Config Server and Circuit Breaker, offering a cohesive ecosystem for microservices development.\n\nIn summary, Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka is an essential tool for building scalable, resilient, and efficient modern microservices-based applications.\n\n###❓ What is Spring Cloud Gateway?\n\nSpring Cloud Gateway is a powerful library within the Spring ecosystem, designed for building API gateways in a microservices architecture. It acts as an intermediary for handling requests, routing them to various microservices. This gateway simplifies the complexity of managing multiple services by providing a single entry point for all incoming requests.\n\nKey features of Spring Cloud Gateway include dynamic routing, security, and monitoring. It supports routing based on various criteria like URL paths or headers and can dynamically route requests to different backends. This flexibility is crucial for modern applications with evolving needs.\n\nFurthermore, Spring Cloud Gateway integrates seamlessly with other Spring Cloud components, enhancing its functionality with service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers. This integration ensures that applications are not only efficiently routed but also resilient and secure.\n\nIn essence, Spring Cloud Gateway is an indispensable tool for developers looking to streamline their microservices architecture, offering easy management, dynamic routing, and integration with the broader Spring Cloud ecosystem.\n",

    readme:
      '\n\n  \n\n The AI-native embedding database \nCurrent Version: 0.6.3\n\nQuickstart\nDo you hate reading? This is for you! Here\'s a super quick rundown of how to use this template.\n\nAssuming we have this template deployed and we have another NodeJS service next to it that we want to use to connect to ChromaDB. You can easily connect by doing the following:\n\nSetting Service Variables\n\nIn your service, create the following service variables:\nCHROMA_TOKEN="${{Chroma.CHROMA_SERVER_AUTHN_CREDENTIALS}}"\nCHROMA_URL="${{Chroma.CHROMA_PUBLIC_URL}}"\n&gt; Note: This assumes that the chroma  service\'s name wasn\'t changed.\n\nCreating Client\nIn your application, add the following code:\nimport { ChromaClient } from  "chromadb";\n\nconst chroma = new ChromaClient({\n  path:  process.env.CHROMA_URL,\n  auth: {\n    provider: "token",\n    credentials: process.env.CHROMA_TOKEN,\n    tokenHeaderType: "AUTHORIZATION"\n  }\n});\n&gt; Note: This assumes that you have all necessary dependencies installed, like chromadb.\n\nAnd now you\'re ready to use Chroma! Of course this is just a quick example and your actual setup may vary. This quickstart did not cover how to connect over the private network, please see below.\n\nConnecting to ChromaDB\n\nThis template is exposed publicly by default. Meaning to connect to it you can use the CHROMA_PUBLIC_URL service variable. \n\nHowever, it\'s recommended you use the Private Network in production. To use this template with the private network, set CHROMA_HOST_ADDR to :: on the Chroma service then connect through the CHROMA_PRIVATE_URL service variable.\n\nAuthentication\n\nThis Chroma DB template uses token authentication by default as specified in the CHROMA_SERVER_AUTHN_PROVIDER service variable. A secure token is automatically created in the CHROMA_SERVER_AUTHN_CREDENTIALS service variable.\n\nYou can change the authentication to basic or any other authentication, to do that please refer to ChromaDB\'s documentation (see below).\n\nDocumentation\n\nAll the documentation is covered here!',

    readme:
      "Your Spotify\n\nYour Spotify tracks what you listen to on Spotify and lets you explore those statistics through a pretty-looking web interface.\n\nGetting Started\n\nYou'll need to create an application in Spotify's developer portal before deploying this template. To do so:\n\nOpen the Spotify developer dashboard.\nClick Create app and fill in whatever you like for the App name, App description, and Website fields.\nIn the Redirect URI field, enter https://example.com/oauth/spotify/callback. You'll change example.com to your backend's actual domain later, but enter example.com for now.\nClick Settings. Note your Client ID.\nClick View client secret. Note your Client secret.\n\nWhen you deploy this template, provide your client ID and secret when asked. Once the backend has been deployed, edit your Spotify app's redirect URI to replace example.com with the backend's public domain (e.g., your-spotify.up.railway.app).\n\nImporting Data\n\nBy default, Your Spotify can only access your streaming history from as far back as 24 hours before you first authorized Your Spotify to access your Spotify account. If you want Your Spotify to have access to earlier streaming history (and you probably do), you'll need to manually request that data from Spotify and provide it to Your Spotify. You can request said data here (scroll down to Download your data).\n\nThere are two kinds of data requests you can make.\n\nAccount data\n\nYour account data contains the last year of your streaming history. It will take Spotify up to five days to prepare this data once you request it.\n\nWhen you receive your data package, open Your Spotify, go to Settings > Account, scroll down to Import data, and select Account data from the dropdown menu. Click SELECT YOUR STREAMINGHISTORYX.JSON FILES and upload all files in your data package whose names begin with StreamingHistory.\n\nExtended streaming history\n\nYour extended streaming history contains the streaming history for the lifetime of your account. It will take Spotify up to 30 days to prepare this data once you request it.\n\nWhen you receive your data package, open Your Spotify, go to Settings > Account, scroll down to Import data, and select Extended streaming history from the dropdown menu. Click SELECT YOUR STREAMING_HISTORY_AUDIO.JSON FILES and upload all files in your data package whose names begin with Streaming_History_Audio.\n\nCustom Domains\n\nIf you add a custom domain to the frontend, you must redeploy the server for it to take effect.\n\nIf you add a custom domain to the backend, you must redeploy both the frontend and the backend for it to take effect. You must also add a redirect URI for your custom domain to your Spotify application.\n\nAll of this also applies if you change the name of the default up.railway.app domain.\n\nAdding Users\n\nIf you want people aside from yourself to be able to use your Your Spotify instance, you'll need to authorize them by hand in the User Management tab of your app's page on the Spotify developer dashboard. You can only add up to 25 users. \n\nYou don't need to authorize yourself unless you're using Your Spotify with a different Spotify account then the one that owns your Spotify application.\n\nUsers who aren't authorized can still log into your Your Spotify instance, but Your Spotify won't be able to request data for them.\n\nIf you don't like having to authorize users by hand or can't live with the 25-user cap, you can try your hand at requesting a quota extension from Spotify. If your request is granted, both of these limitations will be lifted.\n\nTime Zones\n\nThis template configures Your Spotify to display statistics in UTC by default. While you can change this default via the backend's TIMEZONE environment variable, it's better if you just leave that alone and change your account's time zone in the Your Spotify UI by going to Settings > Statistics > Timezone. \n\nAcknowledgements\n\nYour Spotify is developed by Timothee Boussus. I maintain this template, but have no affiliation with the upstream project.\n\n\"Spotify\" and the Spotify logo are registered trademarks of Spotify AB. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Spotify AB.\n\nMore Information\n\nFor more information, visit the upstream repository.",

      "\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   Different  database development tasks\n\n\n\n   Multiple  database systems\n\n\n\n   Unified  process\n\n\n\n   Single  tool\n\n\nThe GitLab/GitHub for database DevOps. World's most advanced database DevOps and CI/CD for Developer, DBA and Platform Engineering teams.\n\nOverview\n\nBytebase is a database schema change and version control management tool for teams. It consists of a web console and a backend. The backend has a migration core to manage database schema changes. It also integrates with VCS to enable version controlled schema management.\n\nBytebase is the middleware sitting between you and your database. It's the GitLab/GitHub for Database DevOps, built for developers, DBAs and platform engineers. As GitLab/GitHub provides a GUI and collaboration workspace for teams to manage code, Bytebase does the similar job for managing databases.\n\nKey Features\n\nSQL Review\n\nBytebase analyzes SQL changes to enforce rules in compliance with your organization's policy. The enforcement includes naming conventions, anti-SQL pattern detection and etc. Prod and non-prod environments can also enforce different rules respectively.\n\nDatabase CI/CD and Change Automation\n\nLike code review, Bytebase streamlines the database change process. Within a single workflow, a database change can be reviewed and deployed from the dev environment all the way to the production environment.\n\nGitOps (Database-as-Code)\n\nBytebase keeps the complete schema change history. It also integrates with VCS systems. Teams can manage the SQL migration scripts in the VCS and trigger schema deployment on code commit.\n\nBatch Change and Query\n\nBytebase allows you to change a collection of databases in a single workflow. It also allows you to issue\na single query against multiple databases.\n\nSQL Editor\n\nA web-based SQL Editor to query and export data. DBAs no longer need to give away sensitive database credentials when developers need to access the data.\n\nDynamic Data Masking\n\nBytebase provides multi-level masking policy with workflow to grant unmasked data access.\n\nData Access Control\n\nBytebase provides a suite of features to enable organizations to enforce data security policies, avoid data leaks and conform compliance.\n\nData Rollback\n\nStatement-level rollback\n\nDatabase-level manual and periodical backup and restore\n\nPoint-in-time recovery (PITR)",

This works by setting MAX_RAM_CRON_INTERVAL_CHECK using your preferred cron configuration such as * * * * *. You must also set MAX_RAM_GB. For 1GB you just set 1, for anything less than 1GB it is 0.5 for example\n\nOption 2 allows you to restart the service at a defined cron interval regardless of the ram usage. You use the env CRON_INTERVAL_RESTART. You can define it for in the middle of the night to prevent impacting others such as 0 4 * * *\n\nYou must also set RAILWAY_API_TOKEN and TARGET_SERVICE_NAME. The target service name is the service you would like the ram monitor to monitor.\n\nThe template further uses RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID, RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID, and RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME.

    readme:
      "dotenvx in a Node.js environment\n\nWelcome to the Railway dotenvx Node.js template!\n\nThis example provides a minimal setup for managing environment variables using the dotenvx library in a Node.js environment (e.g. http or express server).\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer\n\nThis is a demonstration template. \nThe .env.keys file should not be commited in a real project.\n\n(cf. Development and production use)\n\n✨ Overview\n\ndotenvx is described as a better dotenv–from the creator of dotenv :\n\nrun anywhere (cross-platform)\nmulti-environment\nencrypted envs\n\n🚀 Use as it stands\n\nClick the 'Deploy Now' button 👆\n\nDeploy with the pre-configured environment variables values (production):\n\nDOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION=706afc89eaa09ea9441d0f18f7c2fbbb6c77a201abf47aaa3a607e499a52c51d\n\nClick on the \"public domain\" link provided by Railway to observe the variables being loaded from the server.\n\nHello ${process.env.NAME ?? 'world'} from ${process.env.ENVIRONMENT ?? 'space'}!;\n\nThere you go! 💪\n\nPlease, note that there may be a delay of 2-3 minutes for the DNS to become aware of this new address. If this doesn't work after a few minutes, in the settings, delete the public address (Public Networking) and regenerate one.\n\n(Bonus) To use development environment variables, change the name and value of the private key:\n\nDOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY=78ef7c8b904d674d8a2e468714e4b770a3c7c76b3c09cdfa1bc80bcd862f0036\n\n💻 Development and production use\n\nInstalling dotenvx globally:\n\nnpm install @dotenvx/dotenvx -g\n\n&gt; Install globally as a cli to unlock dotenv for ANY language, framework, or platform. I am using (and recommending) this approach going forward. – motdotla\n\nAdd (or uncomment) the .env.keys file in the .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked:\n\n.env.keys\n\nThen, at the root of the project, make sure you no longer track this file:\n\ngit rm -r --cached .\n\nIf there are, you can add and commit these changes.\n\nEncrypt your secrets and generate your own private keys file (.env.key):\n\n    3.1. Remove existing .env.keys file:\n\n    rm .env.keys\n\n    3.2 Setting up your custom .env and .env.production files:\n\n    NAME=YOUR_NAME\n    ENVIRONMENT=YOUR_ENV\n    YOUR_CUSTOM_KEY=YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUE\n\n    Make sure you don't have a DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY variable in your environment files to generate new keys.\n\n    3.3. Encrypt created environment files:\n\n    dotenvx encrypt -f .env\n    dotenvx encrypt -f .env.production\n\nFinally, in Railway, update the variable with the value of the newly generated key: either DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY or DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION, depending on the variables you wish to load.\n\nAnd that's it! You've just regenerated the encrypted file and decryption keys. Each time you add, delete, or modify environment variables in your .env files, check that the values are encrypted before deploying the file on your server. It's that simple!\n\n⚒️ Useful commands\n\nRetrieve initial value(s) from and encrypted .env file:\n\ndotenvx get {KEY} -f,--env-file]                   # Return a single value\ndotenvx get [-f,--env-file    # Return all values\n\nSet a new encrypted key/value:\n\ndotenvx set {KEY} {VALUE} -f,--env-file]\n\nDecrypt an encrypted environment file:\n\ndotenvx decrypt [-f,--env-file\n\nMore information and details about the CLI:\n\ndotenvx --help\n\n📄 Learn more\n\nBlog post:\ndotenvx · Secure and Next-Generation dotenv Successor\n\ndotenvx:\nDocumentation\nRailway Express.js deployment tutorial\nGithub Repository\n\ndotenvx-node-template:\nREADME with instructions\nGithub Repository\nOpen an issue\n\nContribution\n\nContributions are welcome!

    readme:
      "An integration between Todoist and Google Calendar retrieves events for the next 7 days from Google Calendar and creates a synchronized copy on Todoist.\n\nIt is possible to synchronize multiple Google accounts with Todoist, and for each of them, the title, description, date, duration, and meeting links of the events are synchronized. Additionally, the email associated with the Google account is added as a label on the Todoist task.\n\nContext: I primarily use Todoist to manage my daily tasks, but I'm required to use Google Calendar for work meetings. Having to use a second tool alongside Todoist isn't practical, and Todoist's default integration doesn't provide all the necessary information from Google Calendar: the meeting link and event description. That's why I created this integration.",

    readme:
      "\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nTrack, Organize, and Manage your Things.\nHomebox is the inventory and organization system built for the Home User! With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, Homebox is the perfect solution for your home inventory, organization, and management needs. While developing this project, I've tried to keep the following principles in mind:\n\nSimple - Homebox is designed to be simple and easy to use. No complicated setup or configuration required. Use either a single docker container, or deploy yourself by compiling the binary for your platform of choice.\nBlazingly Fast - Homebox is written in Go, which makes it extremely fast and requires minimal resources to deploy. In general idle memory usage is less than 50MB for the whole container.\nPortable - Homebox is designed to be portable and run on anywhere. We use SQLite and an embedded Web UI to make it easy to deploy, use, and backup.\n\nProject Status\nHomebox is currently in early active development and is currently in beta stage. This means that the project may still be unstable and clunky. Overall, we are striving to not introduce any breaking changes and have checks in place to ensure migrations and upgrades are smooth. However, we do not guarantee that there will be no breaking changes. We will try to keep the documentation up to date as we make changes.\n\nFeatures\nCreate and Manage Items by providing a name and a description - That's it! Homebox requires only a few details to be provided to create an item, after that you can specify as much detail as you want, or hide away some of the things you won't ever need.\nOptional Details for Items include\n  Warranty Information\n  Sold To Information\n  Purchased From Information\n  Item Identifications (Serial, Model, etc)\n  Categorized Attachments (Images, Manuals, General)\n  Arbitrary/Custom Fields\nCSV Import/Export for quickly creating and managing items\nCustom Reporting\nBill of Materials Export\nQR Code Label Generator\nOrganize Items by creating Labels and Locations and assigning them to items.\nMulti-Tenant Support - All users are placed in a group and can only see items in their group. Invite family members to your group, or share an instance among friends!",

Supports speech-synthesis, multi-modal, and extensible plugin system.\n\nOne-click FREE deployment of your private OpenAI ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Groq/Ollama chat application.\n\n✨ Features\n\n1. Multi-Model Service Provider Support\n\nIn the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.\n\nIn this way, LobeChat can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.\n\nSupported Model Service Providers\n\nWe have implemented support for the following model service providers:\n\nAWS Bedrock: Integrated with AWS Bedrock service, supporting models such as Claude / LLama2, providing powerful natural language processing capabilities. Learn more\nAnthropic (Claude): Accessed Anthropic's Claude series models, including Claude 3 and Claude 2, with breakthroughs in multi-modal capabilities and extended context, setting a new industry benchmark. Learn more\nGoogle AI (Gemini Pro, Gemini Vision): Access to Google's Gemini series models, including Gemini and Gemini Pro, to support advanced language understanding and generation.

Learn more\n\n2. Local Large Language Model (LLM) Support\n\n\n\nTo meet the specific needs of users, LobeChat also supports the use of local models based on Ollama, allowing users to flexibly use their own or third-party models.\n\n&gt; TIP\n&gt;\n&gt; Learn more about 📘 Using Ollama in LobeChat by checking it out.\n\n3. Model Visual Recognition\n\n\n\nLobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest gpt-4-vision model with visual recognition capabilities,\na multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box,\nand the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this,\ncreating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.\n\nThis feature opens up new interactive methods, allowing communication to transcend text and include a wealth of visual elements.\nWhether it's sharing images in daily use or interpreting images within specific industries, the agent provides an outstanding conversational experience.\n\n4. TTS &amp; STT Voice Conversation\n\n\n\nLobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs,\nallowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.\n\nMoreover, TTS offers an excellent solution for those who prefer auditory learning or desire to receive information while busy.\nIn LobeChat, we have meticulously selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds.\nUsers can choose the voice that suits their personal preferences or specific scenarios, resulting in a personalized communication experience.\n\n5. Text to Image Generation\n\n\n\nWith support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as DALL-E 3, MidJourney, and Pollinations, the agents are now equipped to transform your ideas into images.\n\nThis enables a more private and immersive creative process, allowing for the seamless integration of visual storytelling into your personal dialogue with the agent.\n\n6. Plugin System (Function Calling)\n\n\n\nThe plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeChat assistant.\n\nBy utilizing plugins, LobeChat assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.\n\nIn addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.\n\n7. Agent Market (GPTs)\n\n\n\nIn LobeChat Agent Marketplace, creators can discover a vibrant and innovative community that brings together a multitude of well-designed agents,\nwhich not only play an important role in work scenarios but also offer great convenience in learning processes.\nOur marketplace is not just a showcase platform but also a collaborative space. Here, everyone can contribute their wisdom and share the agents they have developed.\n\n8. Mobile Device Adaptation\n\n\n\nWe have carried out a series of optimization designs for mobile devices to enhance the user's mobile experience. Currently, we are iterating on the mobile user experience to achieve smoother and more intuitive interactions. If you have any suggestions or ideas, we welcome you to provide feedback through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.\n\n* What's more\n\nBeside these features, LobeChat also have much better basic technique underground:\n\n[x] 💨 Quick Deployment: Using the Vercel platform or docker image, you can deploy with just one click and complete the process within 1 minute without any complex configuration.\n[x] 🌐 Custom Domain: If users have their own domain, they can bind it to the platform for quick access to the dialogue agent from anywhere.\n[x] 🔒 Privacy Protection: All data is stored locally in the user's browser, ensuring user privacy.\n[x] 💎 Exquisite UI Design: With a carefully designed interface, it offers an elegant appearance and smooth interaction.

This is where Flask and JWT are configured, and where routes are registered to the application.\nThe User model in user.py represents a user in the system, which includes a pre-save hooks to hash passwords and update the timestamp.\n\nSetup and Usage\n\nClone the repository\n\n    git clone https://github.com/CrACK000/easy-python-backend-app.git\n\n\nInstall the requirements\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nRun the application\n\n    flask run\n\n\nAccess the apis at http://localhost:5000 to register, login or perform other actions.\n\n✉️ API Testing with Postman\n\nThis Python Flask API provides different endpoints for managing user registration, login, and profile updates. \nThe API can be tested using different tools like Postman, cURL etc. In this documentation, we demonstrate \nhow to test the API using the Postman tool.\n\nBefore testing, ensure that you are running your application locally. Refer to the main README.md for the instructions on how to run the application.\n\nImporting Postman Collection\n\nA Postman collection called postman_collection.json is included in the root directory \nof this project\'s GitHub repository. This collection includes the requests needed to \ntest the user registration, login, profile checking and profile updates.\n\nTo use this collection:\n\nClone or download this repository to your local machine.\nOpen Postman.\nClick on the Import button on the top left corner.\nSelect the postman_collection.json file from your local directory.\n\nThe collection should be imported into Postman, and you can use it to test the different endpoints.\n\nRegister\n\nMethod : POST\nURL Path : /register\nFormdata : username password email\n\nThis endpoint is used to register a new user. The request should include username, password and email in the form data.\n\nLogin\n\nMethod : POST\nURL Path : /login\nFormdata : username password\n\nThis endpoint is used to login a user. The request should include username and password in the form data. \nOn successful login, it returns a JWT access token, remember to replace it with  for the \nfollowing requests.\n\nCheck Auth\n\nMethod : GET\nURL Path : /checkAuth\nHeaders : Authorization : Bearer \n\nThis endpoint is used to verify the user\'s JWT access token is valid or not. Replace  with \nthe token rendered after user login.\n\nEdit Profile\n\nMethod : PATCH\nURL Path : /updateProfile\nHeaders : Authorization : Bearer \nFormdata : new_username\n\nThis endpoint is used to updated the username of the user. Replace  with the token rendered \nafter user login. new_username is the username you want to update to.\n\nNote\n\nThe JWT token obtained from the /login endpoint will be used in the Authorization header for \nthe /checkAuth and /editProfile requests as Bearer . Note that this token will expire \naccording to the expiration time set in your application (default is 15 minutes), so if your \ntesting takes longer than that, you will need to login again to get a new token.\n\nIf the token expires or is otherwise incorrect, the server will respond with a 401 error. \nThis means "unauthorized", so if you see this, you know you need to check your authorization header.\n\n🐋 Dockerized Flask Application\n\nThis application is a simple Flask application that has been Dockerized for consistency across \ndifferent environments.\n\nBuilding the Docker Image\n\nTo build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:\n\nReplace "my-app" with the name you want to assign to the Docker image.\n\nRunning the Docker Image\n\nTo run the image, enter:docker run -p 5000:5000 my-appReplace "my-app" with the name of the Docker image you created. This will start a Docker container \nfrom the image and bind it to port 5000.\n\nTesting the Application\n\nOnce the Docker container is running, you can test the application by navigating to \nhttp://localhost:5000 in your web browser.\n\nStopping the Docker Container\n\nTo stop a running Docker container, first determine the container ID by running:docker psThen, stop the container by running:docker stop `\n\nReplace  with the actual container ID.\n\n\nRemember to stop the Docker container when you\'re finished to free up system resources.',

    description: "A high-performance, distributed memory object caching system",
    readme:
      '\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nMemcached\n\nA high-performance, distributed memory object caching system\n\nNotes:\n\nThis template comes exposed publicly via the TCP proxy, yet it does not come with any authentication mechanism, you may want to remove its public TCP proxy and connect to it exclusively over the private network.\n\nMemcached\n\nFree &amp; open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.\n\nMemcached is an in-memory key-value store for small arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.\n\nMemcached is simple yet powerful. Its simple design promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches. Its API is available for most popular languages.\n\nSee the memcached.org about page for a brief overview.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nMemcached is a developer tool, not a "code accelerator", nor is it database middleware. If you\'re trying to set up an application you have downloaded or purchased to use memcached, read your app\'s documentation. This wiki and community will not be able to help you.\n\nWhat is it Made Up Of?\n\nClient software, which is given a list of available memcached servers.\nA client-based hashing algorithm, which chooses a server based on the "key".\nServer software, which stores values with their keys into an internal hash table.\nLRU, which determine when to throw out old data (if out of memory), or reuse memory.\n\nDesign Philosophy\n\nSimple Key/Value Store\n\nThe server does not care what your data looks like. Items are made up of a key, an expiration time, optional flags, and raw data. It does not understand data structures; you must upload data that is pre-serialized. Some commands (incr/decr) may operate on the underlying data, but in a simple manner.\n\nLogic Half in Client, Half in Server\n\nA "memcached implementation" is partially in a client, and partially in a server. Clients understand how to choose which server to read or write to for an item, what to do when it cannot contact a server.\n\nThe servers understand how to store and fetch items. They also manage when to evict or reuse memory.\n\nServers are Disconnected From Each Other\n\nMemcached servers are unaware of each other. There is no crosstalk, no syncronization, no broadcasting, no replication. Adding servers increases the available memory. Cache invalidation is simplified, as clients delete or overwrite data on the server which owns it directly.\n\nO(1)\n\nAll commands are implemented to be as fast and lock-friendly as possible. This gives allows near-deterministic query speeds for all use cases.\n\nQueries on slow machines should run in well under 1ms. High end servers can serve millions of keys per second in throughput.\n\nForgetting is a Feature\n\nMemcached is, by default, a Least Recently Used cache. Items expire after a specified amount of time. Both of these are elegant solutions to many problems; Expire items after a minute to limit stale data being returned, or flush unused data in an effort to retain frequently requested information.\n\nNo "pauses" waiting for a garbage collector ensures low latency, and free space is lazily reclaimed.\n\nSee LRU documentation for more details on the latest algorithm.\n\nCache Invalidation\n\nRather than broadcasting changes to all available hosts, clients directly address the server holding the data to be invalidated.',

    description: "A Database Built for Scale",
    readme:
      "\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nA Database Built for Scale\n\nKeyDB is a fully open source database, backed by Snap, and a faster drop in alternative to Redis\n\nWhat is KeyDB?\n\nKeyDB is a high performance fork of Redis with a focus on multithreading, memory efficiency, and high throughput. In addition to performance improvements, KeyDB offers features such as Active Replication, FLASH Storage and Subkey Expires. KeyDB has a MVCC architecture that allows you to execute queries such as KEYS and SCAN without blocking the database and degrading performance.\n\nKeyDB maintains full compatibility with the Redis protocol, modules, and scripts. This includes the atomicity guarantees for scripts and transactions. Because KeyDB keeps in sync with Redis development KeyDB is a superset of Redis functionality, making KeyDB a drop in replacement for existing Redis deployments.\n\nOn the same hardware KeyDB can achieve significantly higher throughput than Redis. Active-Replication simplifies hot-spare failover allowing you to easily distribute writes over replicas and use simple TCP based load balancing/failover. KeyDB's higher performance allows you to do more on less hardware which reduces operation costs and complexity.\n\nFeatures\n\nKeyDB Speeds Up The User Experience For Any Project.\n\nWhether you're starting small or serving millions of users,\nKeyDB enables you to provide a fast and reliable experience to your users.\n\nHigh Throughput: KeyDB is meant to handle heavy workloads with a single node benchmarking at over 1 million ops/sec. KeyDB is a multithreaded database and will outperform Redis on a per-node basis.\n\nLow Latency: By keeping data in-memory, KeyDB can serve up data with submillisecond latencies.\n\nA Variety of Data Structures: A variety of data structures are supported such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams\n\nMultiple Persistence Options: Periodically dump the dataset to disk or by appending each command to a disk-based log. Durability preferences for RDB and AOF persistence are configurable.\n\nMVCC Non-Blocking Architecture: With an MVCC implementation at the underlying architecture, KeyDB can query individual snapshots of the database, avoiding otherwise blocking calls such as SCAN and KEYS. Such queries can now be called concurrently at scale without reducing overall performance of existing workloads.\n\nBetter EXPIRation: KeyDB offers Subkey EXPIREs which enables expiration of members within a set. EXPIREs now also have near real time active deletion that removes major lags associated with old models of removing expired keys.\n\nModJS: Create your own commands with KeyDB’s open source javascript module. Built on the powerful V8 JIT engine, ModJS is faster than LUA and supports many node.js modules to offer extensive library support for common tasks.",

      '\n  \n    \n  \n\nGitea - Git with a cup of tea\n\nNotes\n\nDue to Railway only allowing 1 port to be forwarded to your project, you must use HTTP for checkout and push to the repositories setup in your Gitea instance.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most\npainless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.\n\nAs Gitea is written in Go, it works across all the platforms and\narchitectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and\nWindows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.\nThis project has been\nforked from\nGogs since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.\n\nSetup Instructions\n\nTo deploy the Gitea project on Railway, just click through, all environment variables are already configured for you. Once deployed, visit your domain, and you can start setting up your instance.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do you pronounce Gitea?\n\nGitea is pronounced /ɡɪ’ti:/ as in "gi-tea" with a hard g.\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\nSee the LICENSE file\nfor the full license text.\n\nScreenshots\n\nLooking for an overview of the interface?

They can view or download the file with no ads or signups.\nNo file restrictions: Unlike sites like imgur, Vimeo, or SoundCloud that only allow you to share specific types of files, PicoShare lets you share any file of any size.\nNo resizing/re-encoding: If you upload media like images, video, or audio, PicoShare never forces you to wait on re-encoding. You get a direct download link as soon as you upload the file, and PicoShare never resizes or re-encodes your file.\n\nNote\n\nThis template is NOT maintained by the team behind PicoShare.",

    description: "Cloudflare Tunnel Local Config Managed + Prometheus Metrics",
    readme:
      'This template will create a Cloudflare Tunnel that you can manage with a config.yml file in github, and creates a Prometheus metrics server that is listening to the metrics emitted from the Tunnel.\n\nIn order to use this template you must have your domain managed by Cloudflare.\n\nWhy use Cloudflare Tunnels?\nOne of the biggest reasons to use a Cloudflare Tunnel is so that you do not expose any of your services to the internet directly. Rather than exposing your services through the railway proxy you will only expose them through Cloudflare where you can configure rules for when traffic should be allowed through the firewall.\nYou can also very easily configure Cloudflare Access rules with a Tunnel which will limit access of any service you want to people who are authenticated inside of your own organization, you can for example expose Grafana through the Tunnel and require authentication through Access and now only your employees can access the grafana instance.\n\nHow do I use this template?\n\nBecause this template is using a local config instead of a managed tunnel it does require a bit more setup to use. If you want something a bit easier to deploy I would recommend the following: Cloudflare Tunnel Template\n\nThe first thing you will want to do is install cloudflared and login. You can find out how to install and login from the Cloudflare Tunnel Docs.\n\nAfter you have installed and logged into cloudflared you will want to create a tunnel with the following command:\ncloudflared tunnel create TunnelName]\n\nOnce you create a tunnel it will create a credentials file in the default cloudflared directory. You can find out where that is from the [Cloudflare Tunnel Docs\n(For windows it will be in %USERPROFILE%\\.cloudflared)\n\nThe files name will be .json. Assuming this is the first time you have created a tunnel it should be the only json file in the directory.\n\nUsing this file you will want to extract the 3 values and insert them into a JSON string of the following format:\n{\n  "a": "AccountTag",\n  "t": "TunnelID",\n  "s": "TunnelSecret"\n}\n\nThen you will want to base64 encode the string value. The result of this should be put into the TUNNEL_TOKEN env variable.\n\nAs a helper heres a javascript command you can run to get the token:\nbtoa(JSON.stringify({\n    a: "AccountTag",\n    t: "TunnelID",\n    s: "TunnelSecret"\n}))\n\nOnce you enter in the tunnel token you can now deploy and the tunnel should startup for you and the git repo to manage the tunnel config and prometheus will be created for you.\n\nThe first thing you will want to do after deploying is modify your tunnel config. You can see all of the options for configuration here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/\n\nA very basic config is already provided in the initial repo, assuming you already have a service called server running on port 3000 and the promethues server created from this template running on port 9090.\nAll you would need to do in the config is modify the hostname to be your own domain that you want those services accessible at.\n\nOnce you have the config updated to your own domain you will want to update your domains DNS to actually route to the tunnel.\nThe DNS record you will want to create is a CNAME record pointing to TunnelID.cfargotunnel.com\n\nOnce the DNS records are created you should now be able to go to your domain and be served with your service.',

      "This templates deploys pg_easy_replicate on Railway.\n\npg_easy_replicate is a CLI orchestrator tool that simplifies the process of setting up logical replication between two PostgreSQL databases. pg_easy_replicate also supports switchover.

This ensures zero data loss and minimal downtime for the application. This method can be useful for performing minimal downtime (up to &lt;1min, depending) major version upgrades between a Blue/Green PostgreSQL database setup, load testing and other similar use cases.\n\nLearn more at https://github.com/shayonj/pg_easy_replicate.",

Creating the tunnel\n\nGoto your Cloudflare accounts home page → Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels.\n\nClick Add a tunnel.\n\nLeave the Cloudflared option selected.\n\nClick Next.\n\nName your tunnel\n    \n    We recommend naming it in accordance with the Railway project that contains the service(s) you want to route traffic to.\n\nClick Save tunnel.\n\n2. Getting the tunnel token\n\nChoose the Docker environment.\n\nClick the copy icon.\n\nPaste the command into a note for later use.\n\n    Strip out docker run cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token  to leave only the token.\n\nLeave this page open\n\n3. Deploying the tunnel\n\nOpen the project that contains the service you want to route traffic to.\n\nClick Create → Template → Search for Cloudflare Tunnel.\n\nWhen prompted, enter your tunnel token.\n\n    Make sure there is no leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nClick Deploy Template\n\n4. Setting up the tunnel\n\nGo back to the Configure Cloudflare page.\n\nYou should now see a connector appear!\n\nClick Next.\n\nChoose a subdomain or leave it blank if you want to use the root domain.\n\nChoose a domain.\n\nChoose a path, or leave it blank.\n\nFor type choose HTTP.\n\nFor the URl use your services' private domain and the port your app listens on.\n\n    E.g. api.railway.internal:8080\n \nClick Save tunnel.\n\n5. Add another domain (Optional)\n\nThis is useful if you want to have a www subdomain or simply point different domains to the same Railway service.\n\nThis can even be used to point a subdomain or different domain to another service in the same Railway project.\n\nClick on the tunnel name → Click Edit on the slide-out menu.\n\nClick Public Hostname → Click Add a public hostname.\n\nFollow the same steps as outlined in step #4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are done, you can now open the public domain and you will be routed to your Railway service!\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nHow it works\nSet up a tunnel through the dashboard\nTunnel logs",

That's why we designed an easy developer experience that you'll enjoy.\n\nSimple developer experience: Start developing locally with a single command or launch a dev environment in your cloud using Terraform.\nLanguage of choice: Write code in Python, SQL, or R in the same pipeline for ultimate flexibility.\nEngineering best practices built-in: Every step in your pipeline is a standalone file with modular code that's reusable and testable. No more DAGs with spaghetti code 🍝.\nBring your favorite tools: Write dbt models, use your favorite IDE, track changes with Git, and much much more.\n\n🔍 Preview\n\nDon't waste time waiting for your DAGs to finish testing. Get instant feedback from your code every time you run it.\n\nInteractive code: Immediately see results from your code's output with an interactive notebook UI.\nData is a first-class citizen: Each block of code in your pipeline produces data that can be versioned, partitioned, and cataloged for future use.\nCollaborate on cloud: Develop collaboratively on cloud resources, version control with Git, and test pipelines without waiting for an available shared staging environment.\n\n🚀 Launch\n\nDon't have a large team dedicated to Airflow? Mage makes it easy for a single developer or small team to scale up and manage thousands of pipelines.\n\nFast deploy: Deploy Mage to Railway with only a few clicks.\nScaling made simple: Transform very large datasets directly in your data warehouse or through a native integration with Spark.\nObservability: Operationalize your pipelines with built-in monitoring, alerting, and observability through an intuitive UI.",

By combining the traditional disciplines of IP address management (IPAM) and datacenter infrastructure management (DCIM) with powerful APIs and extensions, NetBox provides the ideal \"source of truth\" to power network automation. Read on to discover why thousands of organizations worldwide put NetBox at the heart of their infrastructure.\n\nBuilt for Networks\n\nUnlike general-purpose CMDBs, NetBox has curated a data model which caters specifically to the needs of network engineers and operators. It delivers a wide assortment of object types carefully crafted to best serve the needs of infrastructure design and documentation. These cover all facets of network technology, from IP address managements to cabling to overlays and more:\n\nHierarchical regions, sites, and locations\nRacks, devices, and device components\nCables and wireless connections\nPower distribution tracking\nData circuits and providers\nVirtual machines and clusters\nIP prefixes, ranges, and addresses\nVRFs and route targets\nFHRP groups (VRRP, HSRP, etc.)\nAS numbers\nVLANs and scoped VLAN groups\nL2VPN overlays\nTenancy assignments\nContact management\n\nCustomizable &amp; Extensible\n\nIn addition to its expansive and robust data model, NetBox offers myriad mechanisms through - which it can be customized and extended. Its powerful plugins architecture enables users to extend the application to meet their needs with minimal development effort.\n\nCustom fields\nCustom model validation\nExport templates\nEvent rules\nPlugins\nREST &amp; GraphQL APIs\n\nAlways Open\n\nBecause NetBox is an open source application licensed under Apache 2, its entire code base is completely accessible to the end user, and there's never a risk of vendor lock-in. Additionally, NetBox development is an entirely public, community-driven process to which everyone can provide input.\n\nPowered by Python\n\nNetBox is built on the enormously popular Django framework for the Python programming language, already a favorite among network engineers. Users can leverage their existing skills coding Python tools to extend NetBox's already vast functionality via custom scripts and plugins.",

    description: "Feature flagging, A/B testing, and dynamic configuration microservice in Go",
    readme:
      '\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nFlagr is an open source Go service that delivers the right experience to the right entity and monitors the impact. It provides feature flags, experimentation (A/B testing), and dynamic configuration. It has clear swagger REST APIs for flags management and flag evaluation.\n\nFlagr Concepts\n\nThe definitions of the following concepts are in API doc.\n\nFlag. It can be a feature flag, an experiment, or a configuration.\nTag. This is a descriptive label attached to a flag for easy lookup and evaluation.\nVariant represents the possible variation of a flag. For example, control/treatment, green/yellow/red, etc.\nVariant Attachment represents the dynamic configuration of a variant. For example, if you have a variant for the green button, you can dynamically control what\'s the hex color of green you want to use (e.g. {"hex_color": "#42b983"}).\nSegment represents the segmentation, i.e. the set of audience we want to target. Segment is the smallest unit of a component we can analyze in Flagr Metrics.\nConstraint represents rules that we can use to define the audience of the segment. In other words, the audience in the segment is defined by a set of constraints. Specifically, in Flagr, the constraints are connected with AND in a segment.\nDistribution represents the distribution of variants in a segment.\nEntity represents the context of what we are going to assign the variant on. Usually, Flagr expects the context coming with the entity, so that one can define constraints based on the context of the entity.\nRollout and deterministic random logic. The goal here is to ensure deterministic and persistent evaluation result for entities. Steps to evaluating a flag given an entity context:\n    Take the unique ID from the entity, hash it using a hash function that has a uniform distribution (e.g. CRC32, MD5).\n    Take the hash value (base 10) and mod 1000. 1000 is the total number of buckets used in Flagr.\n    Consider the distribution. For example, 50/50 split for control and treatment means 0-499 for control and 500-999 for treatment.\n    Consider the rollout percentage. For example, 10% rollout means only the first 10% of the control buckets (again, use the previous step example, 0-49 out of 0-499 will be rolled out to control experience).\n\nFor more details, see the full Flagr Overview',

Please change these by opening the Web UI and going to /en/workspace/profile.\n\nBoth MongoDB and Redis are unexposed to the public by default, If you want to enable public access to these databases go to their respective service settings and add a TCP Proxy, enter 27017 as the internal port for MongoDB, and 6379 as the internal port for Redis.\n\nShip Code Safely. Mitigate risks with Production Testing, roll out new features to 1% of users initially then expanding, and ensure instant error recovery without redeployment.\n\nInnovate Faster. Decouple feature deployment from release to minimize merge conflicts. Deploy at will, and release any feature immediately upon request from the boss.\n\n\n\n\nTargeted Experiences. Release features to specific target users, and continuously measure and improve the product's business value, while reducing the need for developer involvement.\n\nBorn for developers.

      '\n    \n        \n    \n\n\nThe fastest way to build Flutter apps in Python\n\nFlet enables developers to easily build realtime web, mobile and desktop apps in Python. No frontend experience required\n\nFrom idea to app in minutes\n\nAn internal tool or a dashboard for your team, weekend project, data entry form, kiosk app, or high-fidelity prototype - Flet is an ideal framework to quickly hack great-looking interactive apps to serve a group of users.\n\nSimple architecture\n\nNo more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, real-time Single-Page Application (SPA).\n\nBatteries included\n\nTo start developing with Flet, you just need your favorite IDE or text editor. No SDKs, no thousands of dependencies, no complex tooling - Flet has a built-in web server with assets hosting and desktop clients.\n\nPowered by Flutter\n\nFlet UI is built with Flutter, so your app looks professional and could be delivered to any platform. Flet simplifies the Flutter model by combining smaller "widgets" to ready-to-use "controls" with an imperative programming model.\n\nSpeaks your language\n\nFlet is language-agnostic, so anyone on your team could develop Flet apps in their favorite language. Python is already supported, Go, C# and others are coming next.\n\nDeliver to any device\n\nDeploy Flet app as a web app and view it in a browser. Package it as a standalone desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Install it on mobile as PWA or view via Flet app for iOS and Android.\n\nRunning locally for development\n\nInstall dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nStart the flet development server flet main.py\n\nThis will open a new window and any changes made to main.py will be automatically reflected\n\nWhat makes this work on Railway?\n\nCustom build plan: nixpacks.toml\n\n    Sets the environment variable GIN_MODE to release for production purposes\n    Installs two needed system libraries libgtk-3-0 and libgstreamer1.0-0\n\nHave Flet listen on $PORT\n\n    Setting port to int(os.getenv("PORT", 8502)) in the ft.app constructor, This allows Railway to properly route traffic to and from the Flet app',

However, we believe Budibase is the best choice for building modern, full-stack business applications.\n•\tOpen-source - You can inspect the codebase, Deploy Budibase on your own infrastructure, and build apps with confidence knowing Budibase will always be around. \n•\tAll-in-one platform - Unlike other platforms, Budibase has a built-in database, External Data Sources, a design GUI, and an automation section - you can build a full-stack app right within Budibase without ever leaving! \n•\tDesign - Budibase apps look beautiful by default. We've spent a lot of time and effort building components that are accessible, performative, and look great. Also, unlike other platforms, Budibase apps work perfectly across desktop and mobile. \n•\tReal apps - With Budibase, you build real, high-performing single-page applications. Your apps can be public-facing apps, private apps, or both - and they can contain multiple screens too!\n\nLinks\nWebsite - https://budibase.com\nDocumentation - https://docs.budibase.com\nDiscord - https://discord.com/invite/ZepTmGbtfF\n\nLicense\n\nYou can consider Budibase to be GPLv3 licensed overall.\n",

These make applications more powerful but also unpredictable for developers as they cannot fully anticipate how changes impact the quality, cost and overall latency of their application. Thus Langfuse helps to monitor and debug these applications.\n\nUsing this template, you can deploy Langfuse to Railway.

Meticulously architected from the ground-up for low-latency (&lt;50ms) instant searches.\nTunable Ranking: Easy to tailor your search results to perfection.\nSorting: Dynamically sort results based on a particular field at query time (helpful for features like \"Sort by Price (asc)\").\nFaceting &amp; Filtering: Drill down and refine results.\nGrouping &amp; Distinct: Group similar results together to show more variety.\nFederated Search: Search across multiple collections (indices) in a single HTTP request.\nGeo Search: Search and sort by results around a latitude/longitude or within a bounding box.\nVector Search: Index embeddings from your machine learning models in Typesense and do a nearest-neighbor search. Can be used to build similarity search, semantic search, visual search, recommendations, etc.\nSemantic / Hybrid Search: Automatically generate embeddings from within Typesense using built-in models like S-BERT, E-5, etc or use OpenAI, PaLM API, etc, for both queries and indexed data. This allows you to send JSON data into Typesense and build an out-of-the-box semantic search + keyword search experience.\nScoped API Keys: Generate API keys that only allow access to certain records, for multi-tenant applications.\nSynonyms: Define words as equivalents of each other, so searching for a word will also return results for the synonyms defined.\nCuration &amp; Merchandizing: Boost particular records to a fixed position in the search results, to feature them.\nRaft-based Clustering: Setup a distributed cluster that is highly available.\nSeamless Version Upgrades: As new versions of Typesense come out, upgrading is as simple as swapping out the binary and restarting Typesense.\nNo Runtime Dependencies: Typesense is a single binary that you can run locally or in production with a single command.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nA dataset containing 2.2 Million recipes (recipe names and ingredients):\n  Took up about 900MB of RAM when indexed in Typesense\n  Took 3.6mins to index all 2.2M records\n  On a server with 4vCPUs, Typesense was able to handle a concurrency of 104 concurrent search queries per second, with an average search processing time of 11ms.\nA dataset containing 28 Million books (book titles, authors and categories):\n  Took up about 14GB of RAM when indexed in Typesense\n  Took 78mins to index all 28M records\n  On a server with 4vCPUs, Typesense was able to handle a concurrency of 46 concurrent search queries per second, with an average search processing time of 28ms.\nWith a dataset containing 3 Million products (Amazon product data), Typesense was able to handle a throughput of 250 concurrent search queries per second on an 8-vCPU 3-node Highly Available Typesense cluster.\n\nAPI Clients\n\nWhile you can definitely use CURL to interact with Typesense Server directly, we offer official API clients to simplify using Typesense from your language of choice. The API Clients come built-in with a smart retry strategy to ensure that API calls made via them are resilient, especially in an HA setup.\n\nJavaScript\nPHP\nPython\nRuby\n\nIf we don't offer an API client in your language, you can still use any popular HTTP client library to access Typesense's APIs directly. \n\nHere are some community-contributed clients and integrations:\n\nGo\n.Net\nJava\nRust\nDart\nPerl\nSwift\nClojure\npython orm client\nPHP SEAL Adapter\nElixir\n\nFramework Integrations\n\nLaravel\nFirebase\nGatsby\nWordPress\nWooCommerce\nSymfony\nInstantSearch\nDocSearch\nDocusaurus\nToolJet\nPlone CMS\nCraft CMS\nSEAL provides integrations of Typesense in Laravel, Symfony, Spiral, Yii and Laminas Mezzio PHP Framework",

      "MySQL Metrics Collector for Railway\n\nDeploy on Railway\n\nHow to replace user root with user exporter\n\nThis template will work immediately on any railway project that has a MySQL database deployed. However, it uses the root user for access, which is not ideal.\n\nFor better security, you should set up a dedicated exporter user in your MySQL DB. The following are detailed instructions for setting that up and adjusting the Railway environmental variables:\n\n1) log into your MySQL DB locally using Railway's connection procedures. These are listed in your MySQL details page.\n\n2) run the following commands to create a new user named exporter. Be sure to replace XXXXXXXX with a strong password of your choosing:\n\nCREATE USER 'exporter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXX' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 3;\nGRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, SELECT ON . TO 'exporter'@'localhost';\n\n3) Return to the Railway UI. Navigate to your MySQL Collector service and add one new environmental variable: create a key called MYSQL_EXPORT_PASSWORD and set the value to your new password. The MYSQL_EXPORT_USER variable is already set to exporter.\n\n4) Update the Dockerfile and the .my.cnf file in your github repo. The appropriate replacement lines are already present, but commented out. Comment-out the old lines and uncomment these new lines. Push your changes. Railway will redeploy the collector with the new settings. Your collector is now using a dedicated exporter user instead of the root user!\n",

    description: "A simple service with fundamental components setup.",
    readme:
      "Railway's Express.js + Passport.js starter\n\nThis template deploys a simple service with fundamental components setup, built-in authentication/authorisation, and a fairly organised codebase.\n\nIn this codebase\n\nAlthough important notes will be presented here, it is recommended to explore and emerge yourself in a dfs way, starting here, as there exists plenty comments that will may or may not help you.\n\nTech stack\n\nExpress.js application with Passport.js to protect your precious todos, as well as chai on mocha for testing.\n\nArchitecture notes\n\nRequests to your service flow pass your middlewares to your routes. Both of them are attached to the main application separately, and you can always add more in either src/core/attach-routes.js or src/core/attach-middlewares.js.\nAll the middlewares attached in src/core/attach-middlewares.js are application-level middlewares. They could all be categorised into the following types (1) chore middlewares, i.e. cors, csrf, etc. (2) business middlewares, which play some parts in the logic of your service.\nIf a route-level middleware is what you need, src/modules/account/account.controller.js is an example implementation. But remember, ensureAuthenticated is placed in the common src/middlewares/index.js because it will also be used in other routes and modules; if what you have is local to, say the account module, please put it there. (account.middleware.js is not a bad name)\nThis codebase does not implement any logging mechanism, because only God knows what library you love. It also does not have dotenv built-in, because Railway injects environment variables at runtime. Do install if you are using this starter, not just reading it as a way to procrastinate your life (but thank you!).\nOther implementation details will be documented somewhere near the code.\n\nTesting\n\nThis is separated from the above section because I have actually tried a few testing frameworks, and chai's interface is by far the most convenient to work with. Most of the time, you would want to test route handlers' business logic (TDD), or a fragment of the service flow (BDD), and chai's should APIs or the normal expects are really sweet. Anyway, just organise your test files as per the existing structure, but technically any file in the test directory that has the .test.js extension will be included if you run the predefined test script.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe predefined dev script uses Node.js v18 experimental --watch flag. If you cannot handle it, please implement nodemon or pm2 yourself.\nSome JSDoc tags used are official ones, but rather a way of notating. They are the only personal thing in this starter, and please feel free to modify them to your team's specs, or your own liking.\nHave a glance at this ESM guide with a cup of coffee, there is a high chance you might learn something new.\n",

Embed them anywhere on your web/mobile apps and start collecting results like magic\n\nNotes:\n\nMinIO is used in place of a 3rd party S3 storage provider, Using MinIO in this template allows you to upload media during the bot creation flow and have the bot send the uploaded media back to the users during a chat with the bot.\n\nThe "MinIO Bucket Creator" Is a service to create a public "typebot" bucket in the MinIO service, Typebot will use this bucket to upload media into, the bucket is set to public because your bot would need to be able to send the media to the users who are chatting with the bot. This Service only needs to run once, you may delete it after the logs of the service indicate that it was run successfully.\n\nUpon changing the Railway domain or adding your own custom domain to the service, you will need to redeploy both the "Viewer" and the "Builder" services, this is so that they are aware of the new domains in use.\n\nUsing Gmail as an SMTP host is known to not work on Railway services, this is not limited to Typebot deployments.\n\nUpdating Typebot is as easy as redeploying!\n\nIf you deployed this template before January 25th 2024 and want to access the MinIO console you would need to deploy this template into your existing project.\n\nOverview\n\nTypebot is an open-source chatbot builder. It allows you to create conversational apps/forms (Lead qualification, Customer support, Product launch, User onboarding, AI chats), deploy it on your website or WhatsApp number, and collect results in real-time.\n\nTypebot makes it easy to create advanced chatbots. It provides the building blocks that are adaptable to any business use case.\n\nFeatures\n\nChat builder with 34+ building blocks such as:\n\n💬 Bubbles: Text, Image / GIF, video, audio, embed.\n🔤 Inputs: Text, email, phone number, buttons, picture choice, date picker, payment (Stripe), file picker... inputs\n🧠 Logic: Conditional branching, URL redirections, scripting (Javascript), A/B testing\n🔌 Integrations: Webhook / HTTP requests, OpenAI, Google Sheets, Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Zapier, Make.com, Chatwoot, More to come...\n\nTheme your chatbot to match your brand identity:\n\n🎨 Customize the fonts, background, colors, roundness, shadows, and more\n💪 Advanced theming with custom CSS.\n💾 Reusable theme templates\n\nShare your typebot anywhere:\n\n🔗 Custom domain\n👨‍💻 Embed as a container, popup, or chat bubble easily with the native JS library.\n⚡ Blazing fast embed lib.

ScyllaDB is released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 and the Apache License, ScyllaDB is free and open-source software.\n\nThis template is specifically made for ScyllaDB Version 5.1.4, because later version has an issue with IPv6 support, use ScyllaDB template instead if you need new version of ScyllaDB.\n\nFeatures\nScyllaDB out-of-the-box\n\nUsage\nAdd a project as new service\nEdit a service's configuration to point to scylla's private domain (or scylla's railway public domain). You can find these value from these special variables (Can be found on ScyllaDB service -> Variables tab):\n     $SCYLLA_HOST\n     $SCYLLA_PORT\n     $SCYLLA_PRIVATE_HOST\n     $SCYLLA_PRIVATE_PORT\nYour service(s) should now be connected to the ScyllaDB\n\nKnown Issues\nIf your service(s) can't connect to scylla using its private network domain, try shorten the domain. For example my ScyllaDB service use scylladb.railway.internal private domain, instead of using the full scylladb.railway.internal you remove the .railway.internal suffix so it just says scylladb.\n\nEnvironment Variables\nMEM: Memory limit, default: 2G\nSMP: Restricts ScyllaDB to N logical cores, default: 2\nLISTEN_ADDR: ScyllaDB's listen address, default: :: (You can set this to 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 support)\nAPI_ADDR: ScyllaDB's Rest API address, default: :: (You can set this to 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 support)\n\nSpecial Environment Variables\nSCYLLA_HOST: You can use this variable's value to connect your software to ScyllaDB. You can also use it to connect to ScyllaDB from you favorite DB (Cassandra-compatible) client\nSCYLLA_PORT: You can use this variable's value to connect your software to ScyllaDB. You can also use it to connect to ScyllaDB from you favorite DB (Cassandra-compatible) client\nSCYLLA_PRIVATE_HOST: You can use this variable's value to connect your software to ScyllaDB (Through Railway's Private Network, requires IPv6)\nSCYLLA_PRIVATE_PORT: You can use this variable's value to connect your software to ScyllaDB (Through Railway's Private Network, requires IPv6)\n\nLearn More\nBest Practices for Running ScyllaDB on Docker",

    description: "Railway Cron.. But Better?",
    readme:
      'Railway Cron.. But Better?\n\nThis Service will help you restart (or redeploy) your selected service on a Cron schedule, this differs from the native Cron feature in two ways:\n\nThe restart action: Can trigger a service restart, instead of re-running the image in a new deployment.\n\nThe redeploy action: Will trigger a full redeploy and replace any existing deployments. The native cron feature will wait until the deployment is in a "COMPLETED" state to run the next deployment.\n\nBoth these actions are equivalent to clicking the restart / redeploy options in the deployments 3-Dot menu but on the desired Cron schedule.\n\nCaveats: Since this template uses one token for all the Railway API calls made, the token provided would need to have access to all the projects in the defined schedules.\neg, If you use a token for team \'A\' all the projects in the schedules would need to be within team \'A\'.\n\nIf you used a personal account token, all the projects in the schedules would need to be under your personal account.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter if you deploy this template to the team or personal account, as long as you provide the correct token.\n\nHow to Setup\n\nGet at least one Cron schedule prepared\n\n    This is made easy with a bookmarklet. The pre-made bookmarklet that will help construct our schedule can be added to your bookmark bar via this website\n\n    Once the bookmarklet has been added to your bookmark bar, open your Railway project and desired service, and click the bookmarklet, a popup will ask you to input your Cron expression and action type, then you will be forwarded to a page that contains your schedule config, copy this long string and save it somewhere for later use.\n\n        Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters\n        ----------   | ---------- | --------------  | --------------------------\n        Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -\n        Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -\n        Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?\n        Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -\n        Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?\n    \n        Examples of some Cron Expressions can be found in the Railway documentation\n\nGenerate a Railway Account Token\n\n    Go to the Tokens page in your Railway Account, click the name field, and provide an accurate name for what the token will be used for, A name like "Cron Schedular" would suffice, Click "Create", then save this token for later use.\n    \n        Note: This must be an Account Token, a project Token will not work\n\nDeploy this template\n\n    Input the schedule configuration string into the SCHEDULE_1 variable.\n\n        More schedules can be added later by using the bookmarklet and by adding the resulting schedule configuration string to a SCHEDULE_2\n variable, and so on.\n\n    Input your Account Token into the RAILWAY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN variable.\n\n    Click "Deploy"\n\n    You will now be able to monitor the Cron Job\'s Progress in the newly deployed template\'s deployment logs',

Plausible is trusted by 10,000+ paying subscribers to deliver their website and business insights.\n\nThis template makes it trivial to deploy an instance of Plausible Analytics with all of it's required services on Railway.\n\nSee the Plausible Analytics docsite for a more in-depth explanation of its feature set.\n\nAs of 2024-06-06 this template has been migrated to the Plausible Analytics Community Edition (CE) release\n\nQuick start guide\n\nClick the \"Deploy on Railway\" button above, or click here\nFollow the setup steps in Railway\n   For information on the \"optional\" variables in the template, see \"Optional Variables\" below.\nMonitor your services as they come up; wait until they're all up. \nSetup your websites with Plausible Analytics.\n   Navigate to the domain for your Plausible Analytics service.\n   Follow the prompts to create an account on the service\n   Follow the prompts to set up tracking on your website.\n   For more information on how to use Plausible, check their site.\n\nOptional variables\n\nThere are several \"optional\" environment variables for this template. This variables aren't needed to get Plausible Analytics running on Railway, but they add some niceties.\n\nSMTP Mailer Setup: these optional values enable your Plausible Analytics instance to send you emails. These can be weekly updates, or timely notifications if your site is getting a spike in traffic. You can read more about these settings on Plausible Analytics docsite here.\n  MAILER_EMAIL: This is the email that all outgoing emails will come from (i.e. analytics@yoursite.com)\n  MAILER_NAME: This is the name that all outgoing emails will come from (i.e. Plausible Analytics for YourSite.com)\n  SMTP_HOST_ADDR: The host address of the SMTP server you'd like Plausible Analytics to use to send emails (i.e. send.mailserver.com)\n  SMTP_HOST_PORT: The port you'd like to use with SMTP_HOST_ADDR to send emails (i.e. 25, 225)\n  SMTP_USER_NAME: If your SMTP server of choice uses authentication, put the username here (i.e. smtp_user, admin@send.mailserver.com)\n  SMTP_USER_PWD: If your SMTP server of choice uses authentication, put the password here\n  SMTP_HOST_SSL_ENABLED: If your SMTP server support TLS encrypted traffic, enable it here (i.e true, false)\n\nProject structure &amp; services\n\nThis template is made up of three \"services\":\n\nPlausible Analytics: the primary application.\n  The Plausible Analytics service is what you'll primarily be interacting with as a user. The service exposes a web application that users log in to, view analytics on, setup new sites with, change settings in, etc.\n  Plausible Analytics is run via a Docker image the Plausible Analytics team publishes to DockerHub. Railway makes deploying images from DockerHub very easy.\nClickHouse Database: the analytics database.\n  ClickHouse is used to store Analytics data for Plausible Analytics. ClickHouse's architecture makes analytics data more efficient to query than PostgreSQL does, especially as data scales. This is likely why Plausible Analytics uses it for Analytics data. (PostHog has a great article on this if you're interested in learning more.)\n  ClickHouse is run via a custom dockerfile, some custom ClickHouse config to tune things up for Railway, and a railway.json file to define deployment configuration for the service.\nPostgreSQL Database: the users, settings, and metadata database\n  PostgreSQL is used to store user data, settings, and metadata for Plausible Analytics.\n  PostgreSQL is ran as one of Railway's one-click database services and is just a standard PostgreSQL database.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIf you'd like to customize your instance of Plausible Analytics, I would recommend reviewing the documentation for both ClickHouse DB, and Plausible Analytics. Here are some links to get you started:\n\nPlausible welcome guide\nPlausible self-hosting docs\nClickHouse docker docs\n\nFeedback\n\nIf you experience any issues or have any feedback at all, you can create a GitHub issue here\n\nKnown issues\n\nNone right now! \n",

    readme:
      "Getting Started with Django REST + Postgres Starter\n\nWelcome to the Django REST + Postgres Starter! This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with the project after deploying the service. Before you begin, make sure you have deployed the template.\n\nStep 1: Set the SECRET_KEY Variable\n\nThe SECRET_KEY is a critical security parameter used by Django to secure cryptographic signatures and session data. To enhance the security of your project, it's essential to change the default SECRET_KEY to a unique and secure value.\n\nOpen the your railway service variables.\nLocate the SECRET_KEY variable and update it with your desired value.\n\nExample:\n\nSECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key_here'\n\nStep 2: Update CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS\n\nDjango uses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent malicious attacks. When deploying the project to Railway or a custom domain, you need to specify the trusted origins that are allowed to send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests.\n\nOpen the project local_settings file.\nLocate the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS variable and update it with the URLs of your Railway app or custom domain.\nDont forget to also do the same at your production_settings.py\n\nExample:\n\nCSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['your_railway_app_url_here', 'your_custom_domain_url_here']\n\nStep 3: Run the Development Server\n\nWith the SECRET_KEY and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS updated, you can now run the development server to test your Django REST + Postgres Starter locally.\n\nOpen a terminal or command prompt.\nNavigate to the root directory of your project.\nRun the following command:\n\npython manage.py runserver\n\nThe development server should start, and you can access your project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.\n\nStep 4: Start Building Your API\n\nWith the project set up and the development server running, you are ready to start building your API. The Django REST + Postgres Starter provides a solid foundation to create powerful RESTful APIs. You can define your models, serializers, views, and URLs to implement your desired functionality.\n\nRefer to Django REST Framework documentation (https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for detailed information on how to create APIs, handle authentication, permissions, and much more.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully set up the Django REST + Postgres Starter and made the necessary changes to enhance the security and compatibility with Railway or a custom domain. Now you can begin building your API and start your exciting development journey with Django and Postgres.\n\nHappy coding! 🚀",

Make sure your application use these key or else imgproxy will refuse to serve the request.\n\nHighlights\nFast and performant: Imgproxy was built using libvips, the most efficient image processing library available.\nFeature rich: You can crop, resize, zoom, enlarge, rotate, add backgrounds, and add watermarks all for free. Pro version comes with even more features for advanced users.\nStability: This template is automatically configured with a health check to make sure your imgproxy instance is always up and running.\n\nConfiguration\nBy default, this template will generate the IMGPROXY_KEY, IMGPROXY_SALT, IMGPROXY_USE_ETAG, and IMGPROXY_TTL to a sensible default value. For further customization, please take a look at the documentation\n\nGenerating key and salt\nimgproxy expects the IMGPROXY_KEY and IMGPROXY_SALT to be hex-encoded. The template will automatically configure this for you.\n\nIf you want to generate your own, run the following on a linux machine:\n\necho $(xxd -g 2 -l 64 -p /dev/random | tr -d '\\n')\n\nSee this page for more info.\n\nUpdating\nThis template currently deploys imgproxy version 3.18.2 which is the latest version as of August 4th, 2023. You can edit the docker image version manually if a newer version is available.\n\nLicense and Links\nimgproxy is distributed with the MIT License. A \"pro\" version of imgproxy is available and may be licensed under a different license. ",

      "MySql Backup - Cloudinary\n\nNode.js application that performs scheduled backups of your MySQL database and uploads them to Cloudinary for secure storage. It utilizes a cron job to automate the backup process based on your desired frequency. The backups are saved in SQL format and can be easily restored if needed.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js and npm installed in the runtime environment.\nValid Cloudinary credentials and access to a MySQL database.\n\nSteps\n\nCreate a .env file in the project root(based on .env.example) and replace the values with your production keys(for production deployment, just create the keys on your server).\nConfigure the cron job in index.ts according to your preferences(take a look at the config.ts file ). For example, if you want to perform daily backups at 12:00 PM, use the following value:\n    const job = new CronJob(env.CRON_SCHEDULE.DAILY, async () =&gt; {\n  // ...\n  });\n\nUsage\n\nThe application will automatically perform scheduled backups of your database and upload them to Cloudinary. You can adjust the backup frequency by modifying the configuration in index.ts. If you want to run an immediate backup, you can uncomment the line void backup(); in index.ts before starting the cron job.\n\nScreenshots\n\nCloudinary\n\nDatabase\nThe folder for backups will be automatically created with the following name: databaseBackups/{currentYear}/Month-{currentMonth}\n\nSql backup script\n\nScreenshot 2\n",

You need to buy a license from their official website (https://foundryvtt.com/) and add your username and password to the configuration of the template so it works properly.\n\nOverview\nFoundry Virtual Tabletop (Foundry VTT or "FVTT" for short) is an application built specifically for experiencing multiplayer tabletop role-playing games with your friends and party members over the internet. Foundry VTT works using modern web technologies where one player (the host) runs an application which hosts the game server and other players can connect using a web browser. As a "virtual tabletop", the software provides a set of digital tools which are designed to imitate and expand upon the experience of playing a game in-person with your friends. Support for character sheets, rolling dice, exploring battle maps, and moving heroic tokens are just a few of the many features which enable this experience. Foundry Virtual Tabletop goes well beyond the basic feature set, however, with rich dynamic lighting, fog of war, audio playlists, video chat using webcams, and way more. Foundry VTT gives you everything you need (and then some) to forge thrilling and memorable moments with your gaming group!\n\nDockerized version\nThis is based on the dockerized version of the software from https://github.com/felddy/foundryvtt-docker.',

    readme:
      "InfluxDB is an open-source, high-performance time-series database designed to handle large volumes of timestamped data. It is commonly used for storing, querying, and analyzing time-series data generated by various applications, systems, and sensors.\n\nKey Features of InfluxDB:\n\nTime-Series Data Storage: InfluxDB is optimized for efficiently storing and retrieving time-stamped data, such as metrics, events, and sensor readings. It organizes data based on time, allowing for fast and efficient retrieval of historical and real-time data.\n\nSchema-less Design: InfluxDB does not enforce a rigid schema for data storage, providing flexibility in adding or modifying data points without requiring predefined tables or columns. This makes it easy to adapt to changing data structures and evolving requirements.\n\nTagging and Field Concept: InfluxDB uses a tagging system to add metadata to data points, which helps in organizing and categorizing the data. Additionally, each data point consists of one or more fields that represent the actual measured values. This combination of tags and fields enables efficient querying and filtering of data.\n\nQuerying Language: InfluxDB provides its own query language called InfluxQL (Influx Query Language) that is specifically designed for time-series data. It supports various functions and operators for filtering, aggregating, and manipulating data, allowing users to perform complex queries and calculations.\n\nContinuous Queries: InfluxDB allows the creation of continuous queries, which are predefined queries that automatically aggregate data at a specified interval. This feature is useful for downsampling data to reduce storage requirements while retaining key metrics over longer time periods.\n\nRetention Policies: InfluxDB supports retention policies, which define the duration for which data is retained in the database. This feature enables efficient data management by automatically purging or down-sampling data based on the defined policies.\n\nHigh Write and Query Performance: InfluxDB is designed to handle high write and query loads efficiently. It utilizes a time-structured storage format and various optimizations to ensure fast data ingestion and retrieval, making it suitable for real-time monitoring and analytics applications.\n\nIntegration with Other Tools: InfluxDB integrates with a wide range of tools and frameworks commonly used in the data ecosystem, such as Grafana (for visualization), Telegraf (for data collection), and Kapacitor (for real-time stream processing and alerting).\n\nInfluxDB finds applications in various domains, including monitoring and observability, IoT (Internet of Things) analytics, financial data analysis, industrial process control, and more. Its focus on time-series data and its performance characteristics make it a popular choice for storing and analyzing time-stamped data efficiently.",

The platform provides APIs to build custom apps, augment or transform data, and automate actions based on customer activity. Event pipelines enable users to connect all their data to PostHog, while SQL-like syntax allows them to query their data directly. PostHog also offers an app platform that lets users extend the platform's functionality with custom apps or build an app for the PostHog community.\n\nPostHog's open-source analytics platform is built to help users build products that their users want. It offers a full suite of products, including event pipelines, SQL-like syntax, and an app platform, that work natively together, allowing users to send their data to one place and provision their account without having to deal with salespeople. PostHog also provides honest, transparent pricing that doesn't force users to talk to a human, and users can watch a recorded demo at their own pace or request a personalized demo if their business has bespoke needs.\n\nPostHog is focused on giving users full control of their customer data, with privacy controls that allow users to track users without cookies, anonymize users, and configure a reverse proxy. Users can choose their hosting location, with options to store user data in the US or EU depending on their needs. The platform also provides full access to customer data, with APIs offering total access to customer and event data. Users can audit the entire PostHog codebase on GitHub for compliance or peace of mind.\n\nPostHog has a track record of shipping new features at a rapid pace, with a major new feature, company news, or something cool happening almost every month. The platform offers a future roadmap that it publishes, and users can tell PostHog what they should build next to get early access. With over 10K stars on GitHub across its repos, PostHog has a large open-source community of 60k+ developers and 375+ contributors.",

CGO_ENABLED=1), it will use [mattn/go-sqlite3 driver, otherwise - modernc.org/sqlite.\n&gt; Enable CGO only if you really need to squeeze the read/write query performance at the expense of complicating cross compilation.\n\nFor more details please refer to Extend with Go.\n\nBuilding and running the repo main.go example\n\nTo build the minimal standalone executable, like the prebuilt ones in the releases page, you can simply run go build inside the examples/base directory:\n\nInstall Go 1.21+ (if you haven\'t already)\nClone/download the repo\nNavigate to examples/base\nRun GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build\n   (https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment)\nStart the created executable by running ./base serve.\n\nNote that the supported build targets by the pure Go SQLite driver at the moment are:\n\ndarwin  amd64\ndarwin  arm64\nfreebsd amd64\nfreebsd arm64\nlinux   386\nlinux   amd64\nlinux   arm\nlinux   arm64\nlinux   ppc64le\nlinux   riscv64\nlinux   s390x\nwindows amd64\nwindows arm64\n\nTesting\n\nPocketBase comes with mixed bag of unit and integration tests.\nTo run them, use the standard go test command:\n\ngo test ./...\n\nCheck also the Testing guide to learn how to write your own custom application tests.\n\nSecurity\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within PocketBase, please send an e-mail to support at pocketbase.io.\n\nAll reports will be promptly addressed, and you\'ll be credited accordingly.\n\nContributing\n\nPocketBase is free and open source project licensed under the MIT License.\nYou are free to do whatever you want with it, even offering it as a paid service.\n\nYou could help continuing its development by:\n\nContribute to the source code\nSuggest new features and report issues\n\nPRs for new OAuth2 providers, bug fixes, code optimizations and documentation improvements are more than welcome.\n\nBut please refrain creating PRs for new features without previously discussing the implementation details.\nPocketBase has a roadmap and I try to work on issues in specific order and such PRs often come in out of nowhere and skew all initial planning with tedious back-and-forth communication.\n\nDon\'t get upset if I close your PR, even if it is well executed and tested. This doesn\'t mean that it will never be merged.\nLater we can always refer to it and/or take pieces of your implementation when the time comes to work on the issue (don\'t worry you\'ll be credited in the release notes).',

Fill the environment variables\n\nCODER_WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL is an optional environment variable. Set this to a wildcard subdomain that resolves to Coder (e.g. *.coder.example.com). This is optional but will enable web-based port forwarding. See our docs for details.\n\nNote: For port-forwarding to work, you must use a custom domain with Railway and cannot use Railway's built-in domain.\n\nNote: You can configure Coder by setting more environment variables. Go to Railway Dashboard &gt; Coder (Service) &gt; Settings &gt; Environment Variables.\n\n2. Attach a custom domain\n\nYour Coder deployment will always be accessible at https://app-name.up.railway.app. If you want to use a custom domain, you can do so by going to Railway Dashboard &gt; Coder (Service) &gt; Settings &gt; Domains and adding your domain and optionally a wildcard subdomain if you specified CODER_WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL in the previous step.\n\n3.

    readme:
      'Agora Token Service\n\nThe Agora Token Service is a convenient utility for generating tokens required for various functionalities of the application, including Agora Real-Time Messaging (RTM), Video SDK, and Chat services. This service simplifies the token generation process and provides an easy-to-use API.\n\ngetToken API Endpoint\n\nThe getToken API endpoint enables you to generate tokens for different application features. This section outlines how to utilize the getToken endpoint through HTTP POST requests.\n\nEndpoint URL\n\nPOST /getToken\n\nRequest Body\n\nTo generate tokens, the request body should contain a JSON payload with specific parameters based on the token type:\n\nRTC Token:\n\n   tokenType: "rtc"\n   channel: Your channel name.\n   role: "publisher" or "subscriber."\n   uid: Your unique identifier.\n   expire (optional): Expiration time in seconds (default: 3600).\n\nRTM Token:\n\n   tokenType: "rtm"\n   uid: Your unique identifier.\n   channel (optional): Stream channel (wildcard "*" is an option).\n   expire (optional): Expiration time in seconds (default: 3600).\n\nChat Token:\n\n   tokenType: "chat"\n   uid (optional): User-specific chat token.\n   expire (optional): Expiration time in seconds (default: 3600).\n\nResponse\n\nUpon successful token generation, the API responds with an HTTP status code of 200 OK. The token is included in the response body with the key "token".\n\nIn case of errors or invalid request parameters, the API provides an appropriate HTTP status code along with an error message in the response body.\n\nSample Usage\n\nHere\'s an example of how to use the getToken API endpoint with a POST request using cURL:\n\nRequest:\n\ncurl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \'{\n    "tokenType": "rtc",\n    "channel": "my-video-channel",\n    "role": "publisher",\n    "uid": "user123",\n    "expire": 3600\n}\' "https://your-api-domain.com/getToken"\n\nResponse:\n\n{\n  "token": "your-generated-token-here"\n}\n',
